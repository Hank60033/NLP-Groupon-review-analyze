" June 18, 2018","Fantastic, quaint winery. Our (girlfriend and myself) tour guide (Lady with glasses. Hate that I can‚Äôt recall her name.) was humorous and personable. There are many choices to select from for sampling. We were given a bottle each to take home and we still purchased another. I‚Äôd certainly venture to Tomasello again.",Gus R.,5,1,1
" December 13, 2018","Great place! Loved their wine, staff is very friendly & accommodating! I will continue going to this place for a long time. It's a small area, wish it were bigger, but still cozy & we all had a great time!",Natalie D.,5,5,5

" November 25, 2018","Went with my sister that flew in from out of town. The reservation started on time. Both men, forgot the names forgive me, were very attentive. Best experience ever. I have been to other wine tastings and the service doesn‚Äôt compare. Will return and have already told other friends to make reservations in advance because they book quickly. Everything comes as stated on the groupon.",Victoria R.,5,1,1
" November 20, 2018","Had an amazing time with friends, enjoyed great wines, paired with some of their cheeses...Delish! Staff is extremely friendly & knowledgeable on their wines. A small location but definitely don't mind it. Make sure to call ahead for reservations, makes it easier for them to give you the time you deserve! This was our 2nd time there & would definitely go back again. Dan was hands down awesome!!",Natalie D.,5,5,5
" November 19, 2018","Such a great selection of wines, and Aimee was wonderful about explaining them all to us and making suggestions. It‚Äôs also a great deal for the money.",Nina H.,5,57,28
" November 13, 2018","We enjoyed our time at Tomasello. We had a lot of fun tasting the wines and the staff there was very informative and extremely friendly. However, they were out of quite a few wines that we wanted to taste, so that was a bummer. Additionally, the bottle that I got to take home smells and tastes like burnt rubber, another bummer. So overall, a fun social experience, but not the best wine experience.",Jessica L.,3,1,1
" November 11, 2018",Always an enjoyable experience.,Theresa C.,5,9,8
" October 18, 2018","Nice interaction with Jackie, not pushy, asked me my wine preferences and let me taste whatever I wanted.",Jeff D.,5,17,11

" September 29, 2018",The wine tasting experience was very good.  I like the way they took the time to go through what is included with the Groupon purchase before we got started.  Very comfortable and engaging . The locations seems a little remote but the farm had really great blueberry pies.  Food is a bit pricey  but good quality.  I left out a star because of the location and surroundings.,Esther M.,4,4,1

" August 19, 2018","Took my mom here for her birthday. We had an amazing time. The person doing out wine tasting was so knowledgable and worked very hard to recommend wines to us based on our preferences. We ate lunch that we bought at Abma's outside at one of the picnic tables, and purchased a fantastic dessert after our wine tasting. We will definitely be back.",Sara S.,5,11,5
" August 19, 2018",The woman handling the wine tasting did an excellent job in explaining the types of wines.  She was very friendly and helpful.  I‚Äôve already recommended this tour to friends.

" June 5, 2018",This winery is in a nice area. Although it is in a very small spot inside of a market and is hard to move around. I got the groupon for me and three of my friends and we all felt rushed to be done with the taste testings. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly and the wine was good but it just wasn't the experience I was expecting it to be.,Jenna A.,3,1,1

" April 11, 2015",Nadine was great! There were so many wines to choose from. We decided in the realign and sparkling blueberry. Their ice wine was so good we sprung for the extra $22 for it!,Angela M.,5,24,15
" September 2, 2017",Great wines!! Staff very knowledgeable!! Best deal on wine tasting!!!,Rebecca B.,5,121,103
" January 2, 2018","The ""wine tasting"" took place inside a farm market (sounds charming, but it isn't) at a small counter maybe 3 people wide.  There was a family ahead of us & we were asked to listen to tail end of their presentation, to save some time so they could catch up & not run late for the next group.  We were rushed through the whole 20 minute experience.  The only saving grace was that the wines were tasty & one of the women seemed to know a great deal about the product.  I would never go back or recommend this to anyone.  The drive there from Paramus was longer than the whole tasting.  It was disappointing.",Susan B.,2,4,2
" April 23, 2017",We really enjoyed the personal attention received. The staff was knowledgeable and attentive. The wines we tasted were very good. We purchased a couple bottles of wine as well.,Diane C.,5,52,21
" February 16, 2015","The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different wines available to sample. I enjoyed all the wines I tasted, and can't wait to go back to buy another bottle. There is also a market with delicious salads, sandwiches and yummy treats as well as a petting/feeding zoo on the premises.",Megan B.,5,27,12
" March 22, 2018",Great wines and great service! Excellent experience!,Roger T.,5,6,2
" April 24, 2017",I had a lot of fun and a great value! Even with out the Groupon promotion I would still recommend it! Warning tho: YOU MUST MAKE A RESERVATION! It's just a small table in the middle if the farm store so it can be hard for big groups but I went with just my boyfriend and we had a blast.  You even get to keep the wine glass and can go back to any tomaselllo location for another tasting free of charge! Again really loved it everyone who works there is very nice and the wine is delicious.,Amalia L.,5,2,1
" March 20, 2017",great wine,Daniel D.,4,8,2
" February 12, 2017",Small section in the marketplace but still a great selection! Good wines and very knowledgeable hostess! Bought many bottles as well as the free ones with the Groupon!,Milton E.,5,4,2
" February 5, 2018",The staff was educational and very helpful and the wines very good.,Roy S.,4,1,1
" August 28, 2017",The hostess's were very informative about the the different wines (and there were many!!) and were very happy to answer any questions the group had.  We had a great time and felt very satisfied with the Groupon deal.,Barbara H.,5,13,5
" August 13, 2017","Upon arrival, we were dismayed to find a very small tasting area which lacked seating. It gives the initial impression that they didn't want you to stay too long. The presentation of wines was done rapidly and somewhat robotic. The amount of wine poured into the glass was no more than a sip. This was hardly enough to form an opinion one way or the other. I have enjoyed wine tastings before and have ordered wines on the basis of the tasting experience but this one fell short.",Ron V.,2,13,7
" January 20, 2018","Outstanding staff but the tasting is at a counter inside a market. No chairs & very cramp. They are building a new tasting room, so that would improve the experience.

However, the Groupon is almost worthless. They charge $5 each for the tasting. So for $25 you get 2 bottles of wine, supposedly up to $25 each except they exclude the only 2 bottles that cost $25. The next most expensive is $19.",Rebecca T.,3,2,2
" August 12, 2017",The experience was a bit odd... it was literally at the checkout register in the wine isle of the farm market. Everyone stood on their feet‚Äôs. No place to sit. It felt rushed. We were interrupted by people checking out with purchases. I gave it a 3 star because of the cute wine glass and bottle of wine you get with the groupon.  I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Not what we were expecting. Where comfy shoes,Kimberly,3,2,2
" March 28, 2015",Be open about trying new wines that you haven't tried before.  Staff is very knowledgeable about their product so ask questions!,Jamie L.,5,4,4

" March 17, 2018",Great service and very good wines.,Danny,5,15,3
" November 8, 2017","I expected a little more with this tasting. I actually thought it was a winery, in the warm. Definitely more like a section in the supermarket. The host was amazing, she's from the actually Tomasello Winery, which was great because she was well-knowledgeable about all the wines. The wines were great actually, and very cheap with the membership & discounts from Groupon!",Jessica G.,3,2,1
" November 27, 2017",Rachel is very knowledgeable and the wine tasting was enjoyable for my entire family. I highly recommend this event through Groupon.,Frank A.,5,2,2
" February 22, 2015",Staff was very knowledgeable with the wine descriptions as well as very personable.  We purchased a couple bottles of wine. Tastings were fabulous!,Kathleen B.,5,39,22
" February 15, 2015",The staff was very personal and friendly and dealt well with my difficult taste in wine and were patient in trying to find the perfect win for me.  I look forward to going there again (especially when it warms up so that my daughter can enjoy the animals at the farm for longer),Brian C.,5,3,1
" June 20, 2017",Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.  We needed reservations which was not noted in the Groupon- thankfully they could squeeze us in.,Danielle G.,4,6,6
" August 16, 2017",So much fun! Loved the market we had a great dinner with all that we bought.,Barbara R.,5,4,2
" October 6, 2017","This is definitely not a winery. We were very disappointed with the way they advertise themselves compared to what they truly are. It's a wine stand within a farmers market. Friendly young ladies but extremely poor experience due to the set up as well as somewhat false advertising as being a ""winery"".",Natasha B.,2,20,7
" July 31, 2017",The farm store was charming. It was a lovely spot. I had a great time with my friend.,Kristen G.,5,15,9
" September 10, 2017",Great price for what you get. Wine is ok considering how inexpensive it is.,Ken B.,4,5,2
" March 29, 2015",Enjoyed tasting the wines.  Nice variety.  Good whites and excellent dessert wines.,Elaine M.,5,4,3
" March 5, 2018",The lady that conducted the wine tasting had a wonderful level of expertise. She was also personable. The only thing I was disappointed in was that we had to stand during our wine tasting because the remodeling of the wine tasting room was not finished.,Harriet M.,4,1,1
" February 22, 2018",Very knowledgeable staff and great wine. Informal but fun,Fralvin M.,5,4,2
" February 20, 2018",They had about 40 wines to choose from to taste.  Needless to say we will need to go back because there were more that I wanted to taste.  They were in construction of creating a new wine tasting space.  You also get a bottle to take home abd it was a really hard decision to choose just one,Ann E.,5,4,1
" January 1, 2018","Great and very helpful wine tasting experience, they had a very large selection of sweet wines and the staff let us know about all the sales and promotions going on for the day to get our best value.",Brendan M.,5,3,3
" January 1, 2018","Excellent. Staff very friendly & knowledgeable,
The only complaint was the space provided in the farm. I did see that they are moving to a larger area & that would be great",Karen R.,5,74,46
" January 1, 2018",Area for tasting is about the size of a large dining room table but they are expending it. It's not a winery-it's a wine tasting facility.  Reservations needed because of the limited space which makes it nice.  No waiting in  lines or pushing and shoving to get a spot.  VERY knowledgeable attendants-like trained sommelier,Mary E.,5,19,17
" January 1, 2018",Excellent! Such a  cute place to go! Rachel was great!!,Jamie L.,5,15,5
" December 30, 2017",What a charming wine tasting experience!  A wine bar in a farmer‚Äôs market is such a fun concept.  The wines are great for everyday and a tip...book your tasting when Heidi is at the bar...she is equal parts knowledgeable and gracious.  Cheers!,Carol,4,1,1
" December 10, 2017","Lovely experience, particularly because of the person doing the tast",Lisa D.,5,7,4

" September 30, 2017",Very informative but super informal. Youll be standing in the middle of a supermarket.,K N.,5,1,1
" September 22, 2017",Such a great deal! My boyfriend and I ended up sharing our tastes so we each ended up tasting 10 wines total. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable,Megan,5,33,7
" September 6, 2017","Nice selection of wines and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines offered. The only thing that could've made it an even better experience is only if the place wasn't infested with too many flies. It took away from the wine tasting experience. However in addition to the wine tasting, they also had a nice selection of fruits outside from the farmers market. üëçüèº",Dennis M.,3,1,1
" September 5, 2017","Great Deal...only wished they had prices posted for the wines. You get 2 bottles free up to $25, but you don't know how much each one is unless you ask. Some are $8 and others are more. I didn't want to ask and sound like ""that guy."" It's still worth checking it out.",Scott C.,4,20,11
" September 1, 2017",The person was knowledgeable. The wines were a little pricey and the quality was just OK. It didn't warrant the higher prices. We couldn't select just any variety for a free bottle. Some varietals were excluded and we would have to pay extra.,Lillian C.,3,4,4
" August 28, 2017",Fun experience! Enjoyed the wines! Very knowledgeable host!,Pattie W.,5,16,9
" August 26, 2017",The wine is really good.  Can't wait to buy more.,Gwen G.,5,4,1
" August 23, 2017","We walked in to the market, where the winery is located, and we weren‚Äôt sure if we had made the right decision, having traveled an hour and realizing that the winery is only a booth in the market with no seating. However, once we began the tasting and engaged in conversation with the wonderful young lady behind the counter, we forgot all about that and had an amazing time.",Stefan L.,5,1,1
" August 10, 2017","We had a great time! The woman, whose name escapes me at the moment, was a fun and patient host.  We tried many kinds of wine and each left with a wine glass and a bottle of wine. It was a great value in addition to a fun time!",Patricia J.,5,6,5
" July 20, 2017","The wine samplings were delicious, and to receive a bottle per person was a great perk! Prices were very reasonable, and wine sommelier knowledgeable.",Joann B.,4,11,6
" June 25, 2017","The tasting was a bit disappointing. We didn't even have a table to sit and try the wines. We were able to sample a sip from several wines which totaled to about only a glass of wine together. There was no cheese to try the wine with so we had to buy our own in the farm. The person who showed us the wines was great. She perfectly explained each wine and was very attentive. I drove miles to go to this though, so to just stand in a corner for a few minutes trying wine wasn't really a great experience. The farm itself though, made up for it. They have beautiful goats, horses other animals, and scenery. I wouldn't pay for this again, but it was nice for the discounted price. One great perk: you get a free beautiful wine glass to take home.",Natalie B.,1,5,3
" June 21, 2017",The only thing it was missing were stools or chairs.  We had a great time.,Audrey C.,4,17,7

" March 20, 2017",Great experience.,Sergio M.,5,3,2
" September 7, 2015","Small tasting area, no room at all but nice. Liz our wine person was great in explaining the different wines.
The Groupon is great deal and highly recommended. If it were not for the groupon I would have never did this.",Al M.,5,30,23
" April 17, 2015","Very generous tasting portions so bring a DD. Also, there weren't any cheeses, chocolates, or dried meats to go along with any of the wines so maybe bring your own? It makes a huge difference!",Maureen S.,5,4,2
" April 15, 2015","If possible go on a week night as you get more ""personalized"" (one on one) service !  Enjoyed ourselves immensely and will definately be going back !",Joan S.,5,3,3

" April 11, 2015",It was a fun evening & good value!!,H. R.,5,18,10
" April 6, 2015","Definitely shop at Abma's Farm after the wine tasting - they have delicious and fresh groceries/prepared foods/etc. The wine tasting area was slightly small, so it may be hard for a large group of people to all taste at once. There were four people in my group, and I thought that was a perfect amount. Overall, it was a great experience, and the people at the Tomasello Wine counter were very knowledgeable and friendly. Try their ice wine!",Ashley B.,5,1,1

" February 15, 2015","This winery was small, but cute. The staff was very fun and friendly. The groupon special that they offered made it well worth the trip. In addition, The Valentine's day snow fall  made it a pleasantly romantic experience. I definitely recommend it.",Darlene K.,5,2,1

" February 2, 2015","I found the wines to be a ok, but not great.  Everything they gave me was drinkable, but not anything I would rave over.   This is not a place for a wine afficionado.  They do have a lot of sweet desert wines, and they worked hard to find something among them that my wife would like. (She only drinks sweet desert wines)  They didn't have any neutral crackers to help cleanse the pallette between samples which did make it a little tougher to separate the different tastes.  I wound up picking the 22$ cabernet to take home with me. It would make an ok 12$ bottle of wine.",Mike W.,5,57,40
" October 1, 2017",Very small area in a farm market need more signage was told didn't need appointment during the week went on a Friday and was told not true in the end just took my bottles of wine and glasses never did tasting,Arlene R.,1,26,2
" July 25, 2017",Portrayed themselves as a wine tasting place but instead they are nothing more than a vegetable store that sell wine. The so called wine tasting happens inside the grocery store while standing up for a few minutes. I love going to the wineries but this one was a total waste of my time. The only positive is that you get a bottle of their cheap wine to take home.,Chinyere O.,2,57,30
