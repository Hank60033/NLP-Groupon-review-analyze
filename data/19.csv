" March 25, 2019","This was my 3rd time to this Winery and have been at several wine festivals also...And would rerecommend the majority of there wines. In fact have given these wines as gifts several times.However*Skip this one! Groupon doesn't save you anything! Extra $10 for full tasting. And Groupon users clearly got smaller pours. Food offerings are Poor!  Had stuffed pretzel (microwaved) & crustless quiche( i
Which is a small round scrambled egg microwaved) But at least it made us laugh...don't plan on sharing .No cheese,fruit,or crackers on menu like most wineries. Oh and our server informed us they don't give out small plates to eat off of unless the customer request them.We did enjoy the live music thou.",Nadine B.,2,4,2

" April 1, 2019","This is my updated review.  My last review indicated that while we very much enjoyed our visit there and the wines we tasted, the 5 bottles of wine we bought while we were there had peaked and smelled like and tasted like vinegar. I indicated I had reached out to Wagonhouse regarding a full refund for the 5 bottles of wine.  I am writing again now as I am happy to report that they did issue my daughter and I both a full refund on the wines we purchased.  Based on this experience, they are now back to 5 stars.",LYNN C.,5,29,15

If you get someone experienced and it's not crowded you will love it. They need to train new staff better!,Berenice A.,2,3,2
" February 19, 2017","Our server was very nice. Decor was ok. However, cheese & cracker platter, part of the Groupon, had no crackers and the cheese was dried out, like it had been sitting out. We did get the 2 wine glasses that came with the Groupon but got a paper coaster instead of the slate coaster advertised. All-in-all not worth the money, even with a Groupon.",Sarah G.,2,1,1

" February 16, 2016",It was 5 out of 10 kind of a experience. Wine portions were very small. Selection was fine. Wine was stored in steel barrels instead of Oak barrels. Wine from oak barrels tests much better.,Rasika J.,1,1,1

 Invalid date,"We showed up at our appointment time, workers seemed unfriendly and mean, they seemed unprepared. The girl who served us our wine was very nice, but didn't know too much about the wines or the cheese. The cat on site was a little too friendly, my friend is allergic and the cat kept jumping on her and on our table where the cheese was and trying to sniff and eat our food. Some of the wines were very good.. but we didn't purchase due to the service. We had another tasting at a different winery and they were very knowledgable about their wines and history etc. Could have been better.",Michele B.,1,6,4
