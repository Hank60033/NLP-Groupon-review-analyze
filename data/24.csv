" May 23, 2016","The vineyard tour was very short, we stood outside by the vineyard and discussed the different grapes for a few minutes and then went inside to the basement where the wine is made.  There our tour guide, Anthony, talked about the distilling process.  Anthony was a very nice young man who was knowledgeable about the winery and it's owner.
We then went upstairs and had the tasting which consisted of about 12 wines which were all delicious.  The tasting was headed up by the owner of the winery, a very entertaining gentleman, who taught us how to pair wine with different foods, offering us different chocolates and nuts - also some wasabi peas for the spicy pairing.   
In all, the tour and tasting took approximately 45 minutes - don't make this your days event - but it was fun for the amount of time we spent there.",Beth P.,5,20,7

" July 7, 2016",We had such a wonderful experience last weekend at Sand Castle Winery. The tour was very interesting and informative. The tasting was very well put together. The wines were delicious. We stayed after for the food platter and ordered a glass of wine to wash it down. We also left there with 6 bottles to bring home!,Debbie P.,5,2,2
" June 5, 2017","I would have given this experience a 5 star rating had it not been for FALSE ADVERTISING. The groupon clearly states ""tour of the vineyard,"" which did not happen. We literally exited the building, were briefed on the history of the winery and wine making while standing in the parking lot with the vineyard in the background. At that point I thought we'd venture onto the grounds and get to see the vines and whatnot (granted the grapes have not yet developed yet). That did not happen, after the brief history in the parking lot we went straight to the underground wine cellar. Everything else was up to par. The tasting was amazing. The tasting guide was extremely knowledgeable, and I even bought two wine bottles. I find it upsetting that the description stated one thing, while what actually happened was another. I even overhead other guests exclaiming how they thought we'd get an actual tour of the vineyard grounds, so it's not like I was the only one expecting this. I brought my girlfriend to Sand Castle for her birthday, so I was extremely upset. 

If you're looking for a wine tasting, this winery will suffice. If you want a tangible vineyard tour, look somewhere else.",Travis G.,3,1,1
" August 17, 2016","It was a beautiful place, tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable. The wine was delicious and the little picnic of cheese and crackers was just enough! The tour was a little short and they had men power washing during our tour so it was kind of hard to hear but other than that it was a good time.

An all around great experience for the price!",Krista K.,5,1,1
" September 19, 2016","My wife and I went to the Winery as an afternoon ""date."" All and all a very enjoyable experience.

The tasting was done extremely well with the ""leader"" going over each wine and the best parings with a great sense of humor. Some wines were tasted with dark and white chocolate and one with wasabi beans!

We tasted every wine offered by the winery, other than the high-end reserves, and they were not stingy with the samples. My tastes run toward dry wines, and theirs were very good.

We ended up buying an assortment. Sand Castle is only a few miles from home, and I can see going back to restock when they are consumed.

The only slight negative was the ""picnic platter"" that came with the package. Not more than a few slices of meat and cheeses on a paper plate. In the scheme of things, not a big deal though.

Thoroughly great fun and delightful wine.

BTW - Make sure you taste the Alpine Spice. It was served hot at the tasting and would be perfect for a cold day sitting in front of a fire. True to the leaders statement, it does taste like you are drinking apple pie.",Paul G.,5,1,1
" June 6, 2016","Was raining so we only had about a three minute vineyard tour, but the tour guy was very nice. Answered all our questions in the wine cellar and didn't rush us at all. Wine tasting was fun and informative, only thing was that the glass to empty your wine glasses into was very dirty! Even though it obviously wasn't there to drink from, it gave a careless impression. Also there was a chair in side where we sat for our ""picnic platter"" that was extremely dusty. Feel bad saying the negatives since everyone was very nice, but I just felt this beautiful castle could use some extra TLC.  Great wine selection, didn't leave empty handed!",Barbara T.,5,1,1

" September 12, 2016","We purchased the tour, tasting and platter package for a group of 12 and it was my first time at a winery so i didn't know what to expect.
