" October 13, 2014","It was really busy and the man giving us our tasting didn't tell us how to pair the chocolate until we'd already tried 2 wines, but it was a great experience nonetheless. The wine is great, reasonably priced, and there is a huge variety.",Juliet G.,5,1,1

" August 5, 2014","I never write reviews but I have to say that I absolutely LOVED visiting this winery.  I have been to four different wineries in the past couple of weeks and this was one of my favorites.  The tasting room is air conditioned so it was very comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly.  There is a patio outside with gorgeous views of the vineyard and surrounding property.  There was also live music outside and people relaxing on the patio with food and wine (apparently you can bring your own food there).  The atmosphere was addicting.  I would highly recommend visiting this winery for a tasting or to relax or both!  Besides the surroundings, the wine was very good and I LOVED the ""exit"" wines and their labels!  The ONLY thing which was our own fault, we didn't realize it closed at 5:00 daily and we got there kind of late (that just means we'll have to go back!).",Francine V.,5,4,1

" November 14, 2013",This was my first time at this vineyard. The staff were great as were the wines we tasted. We bought a bottle of Saryh 2010 this was a favorite of us both. We were told it was the last bottle and were happy we got it. We decided to have the wine with dinner a few nights later and found that it had spoiled and was vinegary and strong. I called the winery that night and spoke to Narendra and explained what we found when we opened it. He was very apologetic and offered to ship us a bottle of our choice from the list. Although it was cold and in November we could see that this was a great place to sit out on the patio and enjoy  some wine in the spring/summer. We will definitely be back!,DENISE S.,5,11,5

Also, we visited on a very hot day, and they could not get their wine slushy machine working; that caused our party-of-four to leave a few hours earlier than planned. They could also provide a snack bar or food truck to absorb some of the alcohol that patrons consume. We did not know that you could bring coolers of food from outside.",Norman J.,5,5,5

" June 23, 2014","Besides the beautiful scenery, this is the only wine tasting that you don't need a reservation. ( unless you have more than 4 people) Other wineries discourage the use of Groupons by insisting you make a reservation, and that isn't convenient for most people who decide to go on a whim.  I really enjoyed the pairing with chocolate, that is a very nice distinction from other wineries. Hope Old York keeps it reservation free for up to 4 people!",Cecilia D.,5,4,4

" October 3, 2013",It was a great choice! So glad I signed on to Groupon or I would not have known of this winery. I would definitely recommend it.  Went on Sept 26th and the weather could not have been better for the outdoor setting & scenery on the patio overlooking the winery.  I might suggest packing a little cooler or basket of your favorite appy's or even a sandwich (other customers did) to enjoy with a yummy glass of wine.  It is recommended by the staff.,Debbie M.,5,4,3
" October 2, 2013",I loved that each wine tasting was personalized to each individual (not the group as a whole). It allowed each one of us to try the wines we were interested in. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. A great experience overall!,Vivian M.,5,3,2
" October 2, 2013","My wife and I spent a gorgeous fall afternoon getting to know Old York cellars. The staff was extremely pleasant and the scenery divine.

We did purchase several bottles of wine and hope to return in the future.,Jan L.,5,4,4
" July 2, 2013","Employees were friendly and knowledgeable.  My friends and I felt like valued guests.  Sometimes when you use a Groupon, the business seems to resent your presence, but that was not the case here.  I would definitely go back, even without a Groupon.",Joanne M.,5,4,1

" January 6, 2013",Fun with chocolate,Julia J.,5,49,23
" September 26, 2014","The wine tasting was rather mechanical and the ""bar tender"" never really ""talked up"" the wine.  The chocolate was sub-par.",Judith G.,1,10,1
" September 26, 2014",The winery property is beautiful but the wine is not good at all,Karen S.,1,4,1
" August 28, 2014",Wines are not that great,Marieta,1,14,8
" February 14, 2018",We did the tasting at Bridgewater mall and did not enjoy the experience. We had been to  the actual winery and loved the experience there. I would definitely recommend going to the winery and not the mall.,Debra G.,2,3,2
" December 26, 2017",Coupon works. But the person who poured wines for us did not tell us anything about the wines we are drinking nor any information about the winery. Waste of time.,Eitan B.,1,2,1
" December 13, 2016",Like it but too far.,Marisol A.,2,4,4
" May 17, 2016",We didn't get a chance to use this groupon because the location has a festival just about every weekend and the groupon isn't valid during festival days (even if you pay for festival entrance).,Lisa S.,1,9,9
" February 19, 2016",Wines were just OK. They didn't seem prepared for customers. No tour was offered even though it was part of the paid package.,Ellen,1,7,5
" July 26, 2015",Jason our server was not cordial would have preferred another server,John S.,1,2,1
" June 11, 2015","for the price they charge for their wine, the tasting should be free.",Thomasnichols,1,7,5
" May 19, 2015","The server rushed us through our wine and chocolate tasting,  the glasses were not rinsed between tasting, and the server gave very brief responses to questions we asked.",Carol D.,1,1,1
" March 28, 2015",Very disorganized and not very comfortable for a tasting. The bartender was not very informative nor did he seem to know much about the job. The powas so small that we couldn't even get a proper taste to evaluate the blinds. Forgot our chocolate until we ask,Amy P.,1,4,2
" November 5, 2014","There's a LONG story that goes with my experience at Old York Cellars but I won't go into it because I don't think Groupon probably really cares.   Suffice it to say, I had to get into a fight with them to get what was stated on my Groupon.   And then the wine tasting was a farce.  I've been to many wine tastings and this was not up to par.  The ""tasting"" was barely a gulp,...VERY stingy.",Nancy S.,1,9,6
" October 25, 2014",Terrible service and overcrowded. We went on a Saturday and were rushed from the moment we got there. We think the wine was pretty bad but the tasting pours were so small it was impossible to tell. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.,Devin H.,1,5,2
" September 28, 2014","Didn't honor my groupon at first, said they had a special fall fest and the groupon wasn't valid. I had to talk to management to let us in. They had that nowhere mentioned on the group on I purchased",Inga B.,1,36,13
" June 17, 2014","Not worth the money spent - only one type of cheese offered, along with extremely small tastes of about 8 different wines (most of which were average at best) The only aspect that was well done was the tour, given by the friendly and knowledgeable guide.",Lee B.,1,36,17
" March 8, 2014","I've been there several times before and am even a case club member.  This past experience felt very rushed and there weren't a lot of people there so I can't quite understand it.  This is the first time I've been dissatisfied with this place.  It is usually a great time out with friends and we usually buy quite a bit of wine.  In fact we still bought over 2 cases on this trip, but I'm not sure I can talk them into going back.",Belynda V.,1,3,3
" November 26, 2013",The wines were nice but when my friend and I walked in we were not greeted and felt a bit rushed during the tasting .. I purchased a bottle of wine but the service was not what I expected .. As it being my first time I would have expected better service.. I will probably not return and that stinks because I really did enjoy the wine !! Just wish i had a better experience,Brittany D.,1,8,6
" October 22, 2013",They didn't hardly give you any wine to taste it.  Definitely not going back.,Dianne M.,1,1,1
" September 30, 2013",they didnt offer any choice platters of cheese or sides to buy there was no where to sit inside while tasting the wine.  It was overpriced.,Christine D.,1,7,4
" July 3, 2013","I had understood by the coupon that the wine tasting and glass for two were included in the price I paid for the Groupon.  We made a purchase and were also charged $10 for wine tasting.  I didn't see the charge until I was home and reviewed my receipt.  I was very disappointed that the Groupon was not honored!  I will not go back again and I would not recommend anyone else to purchase this offer, the winery does not honor them!!",Kathy W.,1,2,2
" May 7, 2013","The scenary was beautiful; however, I wasn't a big fan of their wine.",Carol A.,1,21,10
" April 23, 2013",Have been to more informative wine pairings offered by Groupon. The one At the SAND CaSTLE WINERY was fabulous.,ROBERTA M.,1,10,5
" April 22, 2013",I think it should be better explained that a tasting is barely enough wine to fill half a glass.,Melanie R.,1,35,12
