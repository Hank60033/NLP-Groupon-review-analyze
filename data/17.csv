" June 3, 2018",I accidentally hit the button and it redeemed my voucher. Can’t get in touch with anyone to help me! UGH,Gino F.,1,1,1
" October 21, 2018",The bus driver waited too long (30 minutes) for 5 women who decided to go to Starbucks instead of board the bus.  But other than that the trip was nice.,Cara F.,4,5,3
" July 28, 2018",The AC on the bus was broken and one of the “wineries” we visited was essentially a tented picnic area selling bad wine and packed with young drunk people. Save your money for a more upscale wine tour!,Dalene,2,4,2
" November 20, 2018",The people that work for this company are so kind and amazing! They answered all of our questions via email. The wineries were great. Awesome experience. Would do it again!!,Jessica D.,5,1,1
" September 9, 2018",Everything was to schedule which was really re assuring. Coffee machine wasn't working & for the morning pick up that was disappointing as we weren't sure we had time to stop & grab a coffee but the bus was at least 10min after pick up time so we would have been fine.,Belinda S.,4,2,2
" August 29, 2018","The driver was thirty five minutes late, but Once the bus arrived we made up time and had a great time at the wineries.",Laverne R W.,5,2,1
" August 25, 2018",Excellent tour. It was the perfect way to end the summer !!!,Jamar H.,5,1,1
" August 18, 2018","The bus had old drinks and garbage in my seat.  They transferred drivers 2.5 hours in randomly on a side road. Never told us, Warned is , or even acknowledged it.  Claims to have snacks and drinks but no attendant like the Jitney and when I went to the back of the bus near the bathrooms the snacks were pretty much empty. For the entire bus there was 1 granola bar and 4 mini bags of cookies.",Jennifer C.,3,3,2
" December 9, 2018","It was the worst I want all my money back I’ll we did was sit on the trolley didn’t do anything else went to see the lights we were rushed to the streets that was  it , and do not buy these tickets you’ll be so sorry. I’m asking for a full refund",Pamela K.,1,2,2
" November 5, 2018",Great trip and great staff! Would go again!,Hilary F.,5,9,6
" November 1, 2018","Efficient and the team on the bus are really pleasant and polite. Well maintained and spacious vehicle, highly recommended and comfortable seats. Worth it!",Laine A.,5,5,5
" October 10, 2018","Nice trip, enjoyed it with the lady. 1st wine tour, duck walk was my favorite of them all; for wine. Last stop has the best staff",Carlos S.,5,18,7
" September 28, 2018",Been to much better wineries.,Candice Z.,3,2,1
" June 4, 2018",We had such an amazing time. We honestly were a bit nervous being that this was our first time to a winery and we were going through Groupon. Thankfully we had nothing to worry about. The bus ride was so convenient and the places we visited were so beautiful. Definitely doing this again next year. Bring snacks!! Everyone had a cooler with cheese and crackers. Wineries did sell food too,LAUREN A.,5,5,2
" December 9, 2018",This was Absolutely a waste of money do not buy the ticket you will be so disappointed I fell asleep,Pamela K.,1,2,2
" June 19, 2018",Didn’t care for the last winery but overall great experience. Would go again.,Ebony T.,5,4,1
" September 17, 2018",Excellent trip! Picked up in Medford and couldn’t be any easier! My favorite was duck walk this time!,Stephanie J.,5,20,8
" September 14, 2018","Great trip, great wine, and great food!",Stephanie H.,5,1,1
" September 26, 2018",The coach bus had horrible air circulation. The driver was lost and didn’t know which way to go. He had to rely on customers gps.,Tiffany T.,2,1,1
" August 11, 2018",Amazing experience,Michelle S.,5,9,3
" August 5, 2018",The driver was super nice. The 3 wineries all had different vibes but I liked the 1st and 2nd the best. I wish the time was spent equally in the 3. Overall it was a great time with the girls.,Florence,5,7,4
" July 28, 2018",The vineyards were a joy to visit but the bus was noisy and rowdy. The ride between vineyards ruined the relaxing atmosphere of the Hamptons and the tranquility of the vineyards. We will look into renting a private limousine instead when we visit the Hamptons again.,Josephromulo,3,1,1
" July 27, 2018","Excellent buses and amenities. 

Great customer service (thanks Alana (hope I spelled that correctly)). 

Very convenient schedules.",T M.,5,8,6
" July 22, 2018","Super pleasantly surprised...NYC-Hamptons trip was fantastic : text updates re: bus pick-up status, courteous driver, comfortable & spacious bus/seats, & on time to the minute arrival. Our new go-to for Hamptons transport; would highly recommend for trips betw. the city & East End.",Sarah S.,5,1,1
" July 19, 2018",Enjoyed my experience. Staff was super accomedating and provided thorough communication. The only thing is I would prefer longer visits at each vineyard.,Jasmine S.,5,3,1
" July 18, 2018",It was so fun and bus was very clean. Everyone  was Friendly.,Randall S.,5,4,2
" August 11, 2018",Awful staff,Steven B.,1,12,2
" August 8, 2018",Since it was my anniversary my husband and i along with a few friends decided to go wine tasting. The bus was extremely hot due to the lack of air conditioning. When asked about it the driver said the air is working good. LIES! It was 85 degrees plus 100% humidity which made the bus ride unbearable. The wineries were ok but could be better organized to handle the volume of people. Also our bus sideswiped another vehicle and when exited the bus we were greeted by an angry driver. I reached out to the company before posting this review but no one ever got back to me.,Michelle R.,2,1,1
" July 8, 2018",This was awesome! The bus was freezing though so bring a jacket or blanket!,Lauren B.,5,1,1
" July 5, 2018",Really easy ride and the wineries were very good. I didn’t have to worry about a thing.,Kevin R.,5,15,9
" May 3, 2018",It was my first time going to the vineyards. I was highly skeptical but it was a surprise trip for my girlfriend. We both enjoyed ourselves and learned alot. I look forward to more trips to the vineyards.,Kamar M.,5,3,1
" September 9, 2018",Our bus was 45 minutes LATE!! That’s normally would be a one star mistake but.. I must admit my wife and I had a fantastic time. This is the second year we used the Hampton Luxury Liner and our last. We’ll still visit the wineries next year but I’ll drive and stay overnight (cheaper that way anyway). Hampton Luxury take note - you lost two future customers because of lateness.,Brandon S.,2,3,3
" July 12, 2018",awful.  20 minutes late.  I chose my seat up front but when I got on the bus I was in the seat next to the bathroom despite my request.,Hilary B.,1,2,1
" March 26, 2017","I did the tour yesterday & I had a good time. The bus made 2 extra stops which took time from the tour. We got to the 1st place at about 11. The 1st place was Osprey's Dominion Winery, it was beautiful. The wine was exquisite. The 2nd place was Duck Walk Winery. It was beyond beautiful. Great wine. The 3rd, Vineyard 48 was terrible. Bad wine. Not what you'd expect at a Winery, more like a club.",Leatrice S.,3,2,2
" April 21, 2018","I absolutely would NOT recommend anyone take a wine tour with Hampton Luxury Liner. They were extremely unaccomodating, they left my group at the winery with no notification or announcement that the bus was leaving, and then refused to come back for us! It was literally a 4 minute walk away, but we didn’t know that because we were not familiar with the area what so ever. So the fact that the driver wouldn’t turn around for a one minute ride that we paid for was just ridiculous. The ppl at the wineries said they were terrible and always leaving ppl behind, they couldn’t understand why they operate that way. HLL needs to at least make an announcement or do a head count, I mean ppl are drinking all day. It’s simple customer service and courtesy. Then the owner (when we called the office) gave us some cockamamie all too convenient excuse as to why the driver couldn’t or wouldn’t come back. Worst experience ever. I would do a wine tour again but certainly not with this company!
If you’re looking for sub par and outright rude customer service or to be left stranded and tipsy then HLL is the tour for you!",Rowena P.,2,2,2
" September 13, 2017","It was a nice day out, but I did t really like the last winery we visited.  Also, the bus was nicer last year.",Bri,3,21,8
" March 29, 2017",Called to make a reservation fit the wine tasting tour for me and my friend who was visiting from Puerto Rico and was happily greeted by James. Everything was easy. Gave my groupon and got an email with the details 10 mins later.,Jeffrey D.,5,26,8
" June 28, 2017","Booked   This tour for June 25,2017,
Plain view
First....this was no luxury liner this was a coach bus.
Second..... the bus driver was clueless, he had no information about anything. 
Third..... some passengers on board were drinking 
Heavy liquor early in the morning, throwing up on the bus! And to top it off began to fight.
  My first wine tasting experience with my husband and it was awful...",Lola M.,1,13,1
" June 21, 2017",The bus is not what it seems.... it's not the bus in the picture!!!,Nuria J.,1,1,1
" November 6, 2017",Very clean.  Very nice ride.,Arleen R.,4,30,18
" October 22, 2017","Comfortable ride,friendly staff, organized, great experience",Kristy O.,5,1,1
" October 1, 2017",Bus was 45 minutes late,Linda P.,3,23,9
" September 24, 2017","It was super hot on this bus subpar AC, no outlets and bathroom was not functioning! The wine tour was okay I was hoping for more information about wine and what we should be looking for. A bit lack luster, at least there there was a little BBQ at the end but the panini spot at the Osprey was great! The longest journey ever from NYC",Roselyn R.,3,1,1
" June 25, 2017","This trip was something!!! Be careful going on large tours buses with this company. The bus was 20 mins late... very over crowed. Seat assignments would've been great. You have a range of all ages so be prepared for all of the craziness!!! I tired reaching out to the company while on the bus due to some concerns and Brian just told me "" you got it"" Returning back home a fight broke out on the bus.",Winter H.,1,1,1
" April 15, 2018","The convenience of the bus was great & the vineyards were fun, so overall it was a pleasurable experience. However, we did NOT get fed the whole entire day!!! The final vineyard which was supposed to have food had nothing to offer bc it was “the end of the season.” Highly disappointed in this. So BRING FOOD WITH YOU! It’s a lot of drinking.",Nicole S.,3,5,1
" September 24, 2017","This is not “luxury.” It’s about half a step better than a school bus. We barely have AC so everyone is sweating, THERES NO SNACKS, it keeps leaving people behind, and there hasn’t been live music anywhere. We’re most likely getting a cab to the LIRR because the bus is so miserable and hot. Also, a winery employee said customers complained about the AC yesterday too- so clearly it’s recurring.",Kelly F.,1,3,1
" August 10, 2017","Terrible experience , extremely disorganized, staff has no rules or control over clients , my bus had a group of underaged kids bringing beers on to the bus and screaming and yelling and making racial comments to other passengers . I called the company and requested to speak to a manager - was told I'd receive a call back - never did! Please don't waste your money. This company is awful!!!!beware",Samantha W.,1,6,2
" October 15, 2017","This blatant false advertising. It's not a luxury liner at all. They split the groups into two, ppl full price and grouponers. The Groupon gang gets no outlets for charging phones a banged up bus but both buses have outdated cloth seats. When I made my reservation I spoke with Kevin Snyder and asked about the buses due to reviews. He gave me his word they high quality and new and i was let down.",Steve C.,1,3,1
" December 31, 2017","Super rushed, and you only hop off to Dylan’s candy bar for 15 mins, and Deiker heights for 15 mins.  All other advertised places you only pass by and see via your window. Not worth it!",Brenda F.,1,14,4
" December 4, 2017","Soooo fun!! This is the third time we’ve done this winery tour, and it’s worth every penny!!",Audrey E.,4,30,9
" November 23, 2017",it was cool..... last stop had music.... I wasn't a fan of the band....but I understood the idea of food drink and music .... I didn't see any drunk people... and I was allowed to smoke my cigar in the designated area... a nice simple way to spend a Sunday.,Kyonna Shanel M.,4,1,1
" October 19, 2017","The Vinyards themselves were beautiful. Had a really good time there. Thats the only reason Im giving 3 stars. The bus ride was horrible!! I will never book another trip with them. The bus was loud, their was a group of older women on the bus who were acting like they never went anywhere in the life. Inappropriate conversations the excessive drinking of beer and liquor that were making them louder",Cheona W.,3,5,2
" October 18, 2017",Awesome experience! Highly recommend- i made a reservation easily by calling. Everything was planned out and easy which was nice as we were drinking. Our bus was enjoyable and nobody was loud or out of control. Loved this experience!!,Emily R.,5,5,4
" September 28, 2017","Great day out east, book a trip if you're thinking about it, worth every penny",Thomas F.,5,9,3
" September 27, 2017","Prompt pick up, safe driving and top of the line busses with outlets for phone chargers. Three wineries with different options. My friends and I enjoyed it and plan on going again.",Jennifer H.,4,47,14
" August 17, 2017","I would have given it 5 stars had the pictures better represented the coach bus (Volvo 6700 with cloth seats) or the third winery was a better pick than what we got. The bus was clean and the ride was smooth.

I enjoyed the tour and the wines at the first two wineries (ospreys dominion and duck walk) though at duck walk they were short staffed so we could not enjoy the grounds because we had to wait to taste. The third winery vineyard 46 was not up to par. the atmosphere was decent I liked the more club like feel and enjoyed the free burgers and dogs. the tasting area was very cheap feeling and you could not take pictures in the vineyard.",Chris,4,3,2
" August 7, 2017","We had a lovely day but because the tour starts early, there was no music at the first two wineries and then the last one was a DJ playing club music. No jazz at all throughout the day!",Kelly M.,3,1,1
" June 20, 2017",Great staff,Sandra,5,3,2
" June 19, 2017","This is my second trip with the wine tour. I am pleased to say this time around the drivers were professional, courteous and didn't try to guilt people into tipping them, using a children's charity as a front.",Angela M.,4,8,8
" June 14, 2017",Easy to book! Super friendly staff! I believe I spoke to Mike for most of the call! He was positive and helpful!,Ashley W.,5,2,1
" June 8, 2017",We couldn't find our voucher code and Craig was very patient with us,Mike S.,5,1,1
" May 30, 2017","Don't know what happened, the bus was cold. Otherwise I had no complaints.",Phillipa T.,3,1,1
" May 23, 2017",my contact with them was short but i liked how quickly they got back to me and accomodated me,Diana A.,4,83,32
" October 20, 2017","do not book the wine tour unless they disclose the wineries in advance.  the travel was much longer than stated in the reservation.  We had no working AC on the way to the first vineyard and the final vineyard was a club-like atmosphere, despite it being touted as ""family friendly"" in the brochure.  It has since lost its liquor license for various reasons (vineyard 48).  Prior to it closing and immediately after my trip I emailed the luxury liner letting them know they should not include this as part of their tour and explained what was happening at the vineyard.  I received no response other than an automated email letting me know my inquiry was received.  I would not recommend anyone take this trip.",Jana R.,1,1,1
" November 16, 2017",Bus an hour late with no communication or apologies. Definitely not worth the money.,Helen K.,1,3,1
