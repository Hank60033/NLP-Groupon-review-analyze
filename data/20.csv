" June 8, 2017","The food was quite good and provided a change from our normal, but I was not a fan of the ambiance. It's just one small room with an oval bar in the middle and when we went it was filled with young women who were shouting to be heard over one another. The service was not too bad, but they were too busy than they could really handle and the man we first spoke with said we had to wait because we were using the Groupon.",Lydia B.,3,3,3

" August 26, 2017","The cheeses (from Murray's) were served too cold, but once left to settle down to a more reasonable temperature, were divine. Had a good bottle of ros√©, copious bread from Grand Daisy, and attentive service‚Äîall made for a nice experience. Very loud ambiance, so if hearing your companion is important, go very early: 6pm. Lots of young women go there with their squads, so it's very chatty.",D O.,5,10,4
