" June 3, 2018",The tour was good although the tickets offered on-line were for access to the crown. The tour company apologized and said their wasnt anything they could do. I found it odd they said they purchase the tickets from a company in Mexico and don't ha y any control over what is offered.,Richard K.,3,13,2
" February 10, 2019",Don't waste your money! This place is down to one small building and there was really nothing for my 5 year old daughter to do. She was so excited to go and ended up very disappointed.,Brittany M.,1,1,1
" January 9, 2019","DO NOT PURCHASE THROUGH GROUPON. Gray Line's prices are inflated on Groupon, so you think you are getting a great deal (approximately 50% off). Instead, you will actually pay more purchasing through Groupon vs. directly with Gray Line (not that I recommend doing that either). The Grand Canyon was of course beautiful, but the tour itself was a disaster. Gray Line does not properly coordinate their buses with the additions (Pink Jeep tour, hummer tour), and if there are any time conflicts neither party wants to take responsibility. Our bus was late and we received no lunch (the venue ran out of food, despite a few more buses scheduled after us). Much of the day is wasted on unnecessary stops, pickups and drop offs are a mess, you will be getting off one bus to get on another which is exactly the same multiple times. The trip to the Grand Canyon is worth it from Las Vegas, but I do not recommend this vendor. Their customer service also simply does not care. Multiple people on our tour called to complain, and we were all essentially told ""tough luck"". Only positive from Gray Line was the bus driver himself.",Silvana L.,1,1,1
" September 7, 2018","This tour was the perfect combination of Newport history and tasting of some local foods.  My husband and I ended up having the best fried chicken we ever had in our lives from 'Winner Winner'!  Our tour guides were very personable, friendly, and knowledgeable about Newport and it's history.  We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone - Newport tourist or resident!",Kelly C.,5,3,1

" March 28, 2019",Had to cancel my Groupon due to the company stating they do not affiliate with Groupon. And the number on the Groupon should not be there they stated. Couldn’t receive a refund but a Groupon credit. Ridiculous!,Rosa M.,1,2,1
" March 24, 2019",I followed all of the instructions to redeem this Groupon. Contacted the company twice to confirm pick up info. Nobody showed up at the airport. Tried calling company several times and got no answer. Had to take a taxi. I would not recommend this company.,TARA J.,1,13,3

" November 12, 2018","I would have given a five as our guide was friendly and funny but we booked a haunted carriage ride and received no tales of the haunted.  While sitting outside of the Lalaurie we heard about Nicholas Cage losing the property to the IRS but nothing about the actual history of the Lalaurie.  It was extremely disappointing.  We took our carriage tour on November 2, 10pm mule was something Longhair",Robin M.,2,4,4

" October 16, 2018","The weather was bad. The sea was too rough to be out. Almost half of the boat (including 3 of the 5 in our family) were throwing up in buckets the whole time. It was all you could eat and drink and none of us felt well enough to eat/drink.

" October 4, 2018","Booking through Viator was a mistake. I'm not sure why Tour DeVine associates with them, they are impossible to get a hold of and act as the ""middle man"" saying they will get a message to Tour Devine by Heli. If I were you I would book a tour directly through the wineries they tour, because the tour itself was amazing and the pilot was soo good. We had a great time on the tour itself.",Theresa M.,2,4,2

" July 6, 2018",It seems this company has been bought by big bus and unless you are on the top you can’t see any thing.  We were on the bottom and had a set of stairs to our right so could not see any monuments.  It only made one stop that you could get off on not the three listed.,Tammy R.,2,1,1
" June 22, 2018",I didn’t get to use my voucher because Groupon was “currently unavailable” and then there was a wind advisory that closed Lake Sports at the time we had available to go. Still haven’t gotten a refund.,Venessa G.,1,2,1

" July 17, 2017","this is a us dollar price, not the

" July 17, 2017","SUCH A SCAM. 

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GROUPON – NO SAVINGS. 

I purchased this Groupon without seeing the last sentence of the fine print stating that this company would charge me in US for a Canadian Groupon…. Ended up paying $131 CDN for this Groupon, when the REGULAR TICKETED PRICE IS $120 CDN. 

This is the first time any Canadian Groupon has charged me in US for a Canadian located deal. Incredibly disappointed that this deal is even allowed on the Groupon site. Overall the trip was enjoyable, but after experiencing the trip it looks like all of the whale watching companies work together to find the whales in the Victoria area. So I would recommend going with another - more honest - company.",Michelle S.,1,2,2
" April 20, 2018","What a great tour!  I'm a relatively new local, and it was great to learn so much about the various neighborhoods!  I went on an art tour during Art Basel.  It was so interesting to see other aspects of art in Miami.  We had a fantastic tour guide, and I would recommend this company to everyone.",Vivien D.,5,17,1
" September 7, 2017","good deal and I like it. Also it was very easy to redeem.
Thanks.",WENMING L.,5,1,1
" December 30, 2017","This deal is fairly useless. For the Acoustic menu ($32,50), you'd get salad or burger ($12-17), drink (soda only, $2?), and chef dessert (ice cream only, $5). We did not get any preferences or preferred seats. Staff confused with your voucher (paper voucher required). Also you can't don't pay gratuities (so in fact, you pay tips twice). So it's cheaper and less awkward to be a walk-in patron.",Yuriy Z.,3,11,1

" February 12, 2018","We were running late and Cajun Encounters called us to make sure that we were on our way and not lost.  Our guide was very informative and had a good sense of humor.  It was too cold to see the reptiles, but we still saw birds, and other wild life.  It really was a great tour.  Will come again when it is warmer.",Sandra,5,11,8

" March 22, 2018","This was the best food tour ever! My mom and I came from Phoenix to Las Vegas for my 21st birthday. I booked this food tour at a totally reasonable price, compared to all the other food tour companies being advertised (about 2-3x more $$$). We made 7 stops to places we would never have stumbled on by ourselves, and the food/drink/sweets were ALL delicious!! Our tour guide, Denesha, was great!! She was so courteous in making sure we took escalators, instead of stair routes, for my mom and her bad knee. She was down to earth--you could tell she liked her job, and she was very personable! I would honestly want her to be my tour guide every time! This tour was the real deal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and I will definitely use this company again personally! Thanks for the memories,  TasteBuzz!",Victoria B.,5,3,2

" March 14, 2018","When we were in NY, we did this tour. We met Uncle Jeffrey who was our guide. The tour was so interesting and he made it really fun!!!! What a fabulous storyteller!!! This is a must do!!! Perhaps even for New Yorker's who have never been.",Erika K.,5,1,1
" March 9, 2018","Upon arrival check in at the CS desk was simple and easy. We have purchased round trip tickets and we were provided with return stubs at the same time. Boarded the van and were dropped off rather quickly. Thank you. Great Job!
Returning was not that simple, we reached out to the company twice since our pick up van was almost half an hour late. By no means this was the driver's fault. I am certain that due to the day of the week and the busy time of the day, something or someone got lost in the shuffle.
Nonetheless, we made to the airport on time and we will certainly give them a try again.
Both drivers provided us with good Customer Service.",Elizabeth N.,4,13,10
" March 7, 2018","The merchant was awesome. However, this deal was not a deal and we had a hard time getting the tickets downloaded.We paid the same amount we would of anyways without the so called deal. I will never use groupon ever again.",Haggain D.,5,1,1
" February 6, 2018","Do not buy from Dolphin Tours. The price is the same as the gate price. However, the tour guide turns up at 10am meaning you miss the first hour as you cannot get in and have to wait for the Tour guide.

KSC is excellent and great value for the day for all the family and has more than enough to keep you occupied for the full day.",Brian H.,3,1,1
" January 30, 2018","Parts of this tour were good and parts were not good.  There were a lot of areas not opened and other areas that close early.  No one will let you know that anything closes early, so make sure you ask.  If they put more into this, they could easily make this a great experience for families.",Brad D.,3,4,4
" January 8, 2018",Don't waste your money.,Renee R.,2,29,14
" December 30, 2017",The night was very cold and the boat not heated well so a lot of us were sitting inside in jackets. Standing outside to look at the city lights was therefore not really an option and sitting inside for 3 hours gets boring. Best would probably be to come with a group of people to hang out. Just note that only non-alcoholic drinks are included in the price. The staff were not really attentive or friendly. The food was ok. Overall ok but wouldn't do it again.,Romana A.,3,3,3

" October 13, 2017","This was a great way to tour the Funk Zone.  We were able to walk the zone at our own pace without being rushed.  We had a plenty of time...which you""ll need because you will have lots to drink,  WooHoo!  If when you book and if the Deep Sea Tasting Room is in your package, save it for the end to enjoy the sunset on the pier.  On the other hand feel free to skip Kunin Wines.  The team poring seemed to be annoyed by visitors.  After polloing a few people in the room, they seemed to feel the same vibe.  We wanted to make sure it wasn't just us.  Other than that one ""con"" we feel you would certainly enjoy this way of checking out the Funk Zone.  We will be back!!!!",Randy,5,1,1

" August 8, 2017","Views were great!That many people on a confined boat is hard to take for the 2 hour trip. I wouldn't recommend this trip for young kids. Most kids on the boat were either playing on phones or whining and not enjoying the boat or the scenery. Would be nice if they offered an adult only trip. 
Even so,the trip was worthwhile.",Heather H.,3,8,7
" August 3, 2017",We loved going there so much last year we are coming again this Friday. We are bringing friends that have never been to any caverns before. I know they will enjoy it along with their children.,Sharon D.,5,13,3

" December 22, 2017","Some of the reasons I will not give this deal a 5 stars and the reason why I will not recomend it.
 I made my reservation at 8:00pm, it took 25 minutes for my and my girlfriend to be seated,I had to ask the host why was the wait so long, after that it was when they decided to help us, once we made it to our table there were several empty tables in the room, and you cold tell they've been ready for quite some time, so how knows why we had to wait so much. Something very important they missed to mention in this deal, this offer only includes about %40 of the menu, yes.. they will give you and special menu, a groupon menu that includes %40 of their regular menu, if you decided, for example, to order lettuce wraps you need to pay and extra $6, food was amazing we waited a long time for it,portions were small. Our server was very nice and friendly, but it was funny when I mentioned that I wanted lettuce wrap, they way she asked me if I was fine paying the extra $6.. show was great, we had a great time and my girlfriend was very amazed.
 I would go back to this place, but not using this groupon deal, it seems they look at you different when they know you are using this deal.",Christian L.,2,7,1
" April 17, 2018","Bought it for 2 persons, total value of $136.00 when we got there the staff does not know they are selling Groupons. Had a hard time trying to redeem, called customer service to redeem at Groupon side half an hour later. After that, the problem was: 
If a single voucher is at $68 (included: 2(TWO) Pro Kart Race Sessions for One Person, One $20 Arcade Game Card and a Race License Combo that includes complimentary head sock (balaclava), a loaner helmet, and a year of mobile app access to view race times and stats.) 
So that means EACH one has 2(TWO) race sessions right? 
WRONG, the staff was not willing to UNDERSTAND that we had a voucher for TWO persons total value of $ 136.00 as show on voucher. 
Try to speak with manager and never came to explain why they wont give us the service PAID for two, the staff said theres nothing they could do. Spent my money ($136), my time and my patience. DON'T BUY THIS GROUPON!! DO NOT RECOMMEND! WANT MY MONEY BACK!!",Gustavo Z.,1,2,1
" April 6, 2018",Our guide was knowledgeable and made the stories of the people come to life. The historical papers and pictures help you feel what it was like to live on a plantation. Fantastic property. My only regret is the weren’t in antebellum costume for the tour I do think that adds to the look and feel of the times.,Georgette R.,4,9,7

" March 30, 2018",This was an amazing experience!  Everyone on our trip said this was their favorite part of our trip to The Big Island.  We got to swim with the dolphins and even see their babies up close.  Then we went to snorkel in a gorgeous bay with clear turquoise water and tons of tropical fish.  I couldn't have been happier! The skipper and captain were both awesome.  They were super friendly and helpful.  It even rained a little on our trip and they knew right where to reroute us to get us back to the sunshine.,Mary G.,5,2,2

" March 27, 2018","Great price and value.  Took my family of 7 to this and we were not disappointed.  I was very pleased on how upbeat the staff was and very interactive and friendly.  Food was good too and the show was great! Price is a lot better too. It comes with a pass to go to the sea life thing, take advantage of it because we did not and regretted it at the end.

" January 23, 2018","Captain Bill made our first sailing trip an awesome experience for our family of four (kids aged 10+12).  We all got to try steering the yacht, some tacking and he explained lots about sailing to us.  We saw an amazing sunset in the bay off Miami and had a relaxing and enjoyable experience.  Captain Bill made us feel welcome, safe and comfortable.  He was easy and good company for the two hour tour.  I would highly recommend.",Amanda B.,5,5,4
" January 23, 2018","Charles was the perfect guide.  We were initially booked to go to Red Rock but the government shut down that day so Charles offered us a wonderful alternative hike to Valley of Fire. We were so glad for his flexibility as we were really ready to get 
a break from the Vegas strip and get out into nature. Charles was kind, knowledgeable, and easy to be around. I had never taken a guided hiking tour and would definitely do it again.  It was great to have all the planning and routing taken care of, and I learned and saw so much more than I ever would on a self-guided tour.

" April 15, 2018","For us, this tour was more of a walking tour then a food tour and we were looking for more of a food tour.  In terms of food we started at Sylvia, Best Market, Les Ambassades, and Lee Lee's Baked Goods. We did walk past a lot of places ending, at Sea & Sea Fish Market where we were given a piece of an almond croissant. The second stop Best Market is a chain grocery store with 30+ locations all over the city. Which to me sounds a lot like the gentrification of the city, which the tour guide appeared to believe was a bad thing. While our tour guide was nice it seemed she had knowledge gaps on many topics, struggling to answer basic questions people asked. Okay experience but not worth the price.",Caroline,2,7,5
" April 12, 2018",Horrible. The event did not even exist. Another event was happening on the ship. The ship stated groupon shouldve blocked the date and did not. We go down there pay for parking-not refundable and wasted my day. Now still trying to reschedule,Christine,1,1,1
" April 8, 2018","Nice.  If you can get there.

I would give the tour 4 stars and the floats/props 5 stars.  Transportation zero!  We called from the Roosevelt Hotel and were told to wait on the Roosevelt side.

" March 30, 2018",It ended up being a private tour for the front 4 passengers. The guide ignored the other 12 people in the carriage. The other groups in the carriage also complained at the end of the ride how the guide spoke low and ignored them also. The four people in the rear of the carriage said they did not hear one thing the guide said during the entire ride. Be prepared for an additional parking fee also; in their parking lot even though you are riding with them. Very disappointing.,Ray,1,7,6

To the manager coming over twice and having to pull it up on my phone twice even though I had the printed out version.",Tracey F.,2,8,4
