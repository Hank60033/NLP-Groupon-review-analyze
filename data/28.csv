" August 29, 2018",We had two female guides that were so informative and not just the winery but the whole North Fork history too! They also were very entertaining and made it such a fun event. I have to mention how very patient they were because we had some slow peddlers in our group! Totally recommend doing Petal & Pour!!,Mary E.,5,1,1

" October 17, 2018","Enjoyed learning about the two wineries and tastings were fun. Biking was great. ""Gourmet lunch"" was disappointing sandwich. Some snacks while wine sampling would have been appreciated. 
Over all, glad we did it!",Chris L.,4,2,1

" August 27, 2018",Always a great time . It was my 2nd time but for the future I won’t do a tour in August it was too hot and alcohol and heat make a bad combination for me,April P.,5,1,1
" August 8, 2018",Great place.  2nd visit.,Margaret T.,5,6,1
" August 1, 2018",Had a great time and it was super easy to redeem! Wish there was a little more pouring and a little less pedaling lol but overall great and the people were awesome!,Chelsea C.,5,1,1
" July 25, 2018","The idea is great, and it was well run. I think wine and exercise are better done separately, though.",Gmulligan2014,3,1,1
" July 25, 2018","We went a few weeks ago it’s was myself my boyfriend and another couple. We  had Lance,  Trish and Linda as our tour guides. They were hands down the NICEST and most knowledgeable people. Their #1 goal was to always make sure everyone in the group was safe and well hydrated. I highly recommend doing this ride, we did it and it was sooooooo hot! You won’t be disappointed.",Jen F.,5,7,2
" July 24, 2018",A lot of fun. Great exercise and the Cream Ridge Winery was outstanding. Would defiantly do this again.,Michelle C.,4,3,3

" September 17, 2017","Very friendly tour guides. The first winery we went to was the best wine tasting experience I've had-- our sommelier was very knowledgeable and took a ton of time to walk our group through the wine experience.  Fantastic tour, and would love to try at the other locations too!",Kelly,5,3,1
" May 31, 2016","Very positive and overall an amazingly organized tour. Tour guides were easy going, considerate and so much fun! Would do it again, no doubt.",Alisia E.,5,13,4
" June 27, 2016",Tour guides were friendly and personable.  Great selection of wines for tasting.,Heather G.,5,25,15
" June 10, 2016",If you love biking and wine this is the perfect activity for you! I knew I had to buy this Groupon when it combined two of my favorite things and I was not disappointed. The tour guides were friendly and knowledgeable on wine. Getting to tour the wineries was very interesting and of course getting to taste the different wines was a treat after riding through the,Jessica C.,5,3,1
" June 5, 2016","An amazing day in North Fork! Our tour guides John, Rich, and Ashley were terrific",Teresa K.,5,7,2
" July 5, 2017",Tour guide from Hawk haven was wonderful! Guide from CM winery was quick and not informative.,Connie,5,2,2
" May 16, 2016","The New Egypt bike tour was great!  There are some decent sized hills, and  our guides, Ivan and Linda were awesome. Tim at Cream Ridge Winery gave us a great tour and spoke about their plans to make the vineyard even better and more sustainable.  Got to sample 10 different wines too!  Laurita was beautiful but a little less intimate of an experience.  Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants some exercise and some good wine!",Susan L.,5,3,1
" September 27, 2016","This tour was amazing! We went on the tour on the north fork and from the pretty flat beginner terrain, to the two amazing wineries, fantastic catered lunch of different sandwiches, and lots of plentiful tastings we had a great time! Our tour guides were amazing and even let us stop at a farm stand along the way. You ride on the shoulder of the road which at times is narrow and could make some people nervous but I didn't feel unsafe at all. I would absolutely recommend this pour and pedal tour!",Meghan M.,5,1,1
" September 1, 2016",The people were friendly and the tour was very interesting.,Melanie C.,5,7,2
" September 15, 2017","We went on cape may trip on 9/9/17. We enjoyed the day and guides were good. I rated it a 3 because I did not think it was fair value even at the reduced Groupon cost. Lunch was literally a cold sandwich tray and a shared bowl of chips. There was no chocolates or cheese. Website promised catered lunch, cheese, chocolates. You are far better off doing this trip on your own at over $100 cheaper.",KAREN P.,3,1,1
" September 13, 2016","The tour guides were excellent, the food and wine was wonderful.  The entire day from start to finish was great!!",Lori G.,4,6,4
 Invalid date,Bring a friend and have a blast! Educated staff makes the day enjoyable and interesting! Wine is awesome too,Laura C.,5,3,2
" May 31, 2016","Tour was great as were the tour guides but lunch was a small 1/4 of a sandwich.  With the amount of wine poured, more food was needed.",Rachel L.,5,2,2
" September 25, 2016",Loved it!  would recommend to all - a lovely ride through a part of NJ that I had never been to - and we had a great day visiting the wineries and tasting their wines - bought a few to enjoy at home as well.,Patricia,5,38,27

" August 9, 2016",It was a fantastic time! The guides were wonderful and the wine was amazing. Very informative and fun.,Liam R.,5,2,2
" September 21, 2017",Very organized.  The staff was super friendly helpful and patient.  The only problem was too much wine tasting before the actual bike riding.,Susan M.,4,27,14
" October 1, 2017","So much fun!!!! The biking part was a little more fast-paced than I expected so prepared to work it, but it's great exercise. The wineries were great I'd love to come back.",Danielle C.,5,8,7
" July 9, 2017","Great team on the north fork, who were full of info and quips.  Definitely coming back again, perhaps when it isn't so hot in the fall.",Tim H.,5,1,1

" June 21, 2017","The people who did the tour were great! We had a beautiful day to ride bikes and the wineries we nice.
I had some issues with what they advertised. They said close to a 10-15 mile bike ride. It wasn't even that. A gourmet lunch..not with stale chips. The tour I chose also said they would have chocolates and they didn't even know that was part of it.",Clarisa C.,3,8,6
" June 14, 2017",Two of the best tours guides we have ever had,Dan P.,5,1,1
" June 12, 2017",My girls and I had an incredible day! The pour and pedal ladies were fantastic and this was a great experience overall!!! We will be doing it again.,Christine C.,5,1,1
" June 12, 2017","Great experience at Cream Ridge Winery!  Nice staff, generous tastings as well.  The laurita was good but not as many samplings.  The P&P staff were great!  Knowledgeable and friendly!",Chris H.,4,2,2
" June 12, 2017",Tour guides were friendly and helpful.  Vintners were knowledgeable.  Biking on the bike path was safe. Most but not all of the wines were to our tastes.  Weather was great and we enjoyed ourselves.,Linda K.,5,2,1
" June 8, 2017",The staff was amazing along with the beautiful trail we cycle. Definitely something i will attend again!!,Chanique T.,5,1,1

" May 8, 2017","the staff at POUR & PEDAL was great, helpful, and so friendly! the wine at our first stop Cream Ridge Winery was phenomenal and it was really cool to see how they do things. our second stop Laurita Winery the scenery was beautiful, the tour was really nice, and the lunch (a simple sandwich) was delicious.The only thing I would say is that it is far (about 16 miles) and they don't tell you that in the Groupon description. All in all though it was a GREAT day!",Luisa S.,5,10,1
" September 3, 2016",I enjoyed myself!  Awesome time!,Marcolina M.,5,1,1
" July 31, 2016",Amazing and so much fun!,Sue C.,5,6,4
" July 18, 2016","Great fun!  Had more samples at Unionville, but got a glass from Old York.  Lunch was a generous-sized Boarshead hoagie (choice of 6) with chips and a full glass of wine.  Souvenir water bottle and cold water provided.  Was more street riding than I expected.  Received free opener but no trivia games.",Linda V.,5,5,4
" July 11, 2016",This was a great event.  The guides were so informative and took great lengths to ensure a good time was had by all.  We had access to parts of the vineyards not open to the rest of the public and it was such a great way to visit the vineyards!  Definitely wear comfy clothes and sneakers.  Water was provided as well!,Tracy P.,5,3,2

" May 28, 2016","I went on the Long Island WaterMill tour Saturday, May 28.  The weather I think is the biggest factor for a perfect day, and today it was perfect.  The tour guides were great.  They were always pleasant and very knowledgeable about the area and the wines we sampled.  We cycled to Channing Daughters winery from Duck Walk Winery.   At Channing Daughters we sampled at least six wines, possibly a couple more. We learned about the history of the winery, as well as many interesting facts about each wine we sampled.  Next we took a tour of the wood sculptures on the vineyard.  After the tour we got back on the bicycles and cycled back to the Duck Walk Winery.  We were treated to a great selection of sandwiches and got to sample at least four wines from this vineyard.   When the day ended we had to say good-bye to all of the new friends we met.

My only tip is for you to make sure you have a map of where you are going and the phone number of one of the guides in case you get lost or have any other problem.  A great time was had by all!",JJ,5,5,4
" May 9, 2016",Ringoes New Jersey: Pour & Pedal Bike Tours is AWESOME!  The  Guide is super nice and two vineyards that we went to visit is fantastic! We me the owner of Pour & Pedal he is also very nice!  I would recommend and do it again!!!,Pia A.,5,1,1

" August 21, 2017","This tour should have been cancelled. There was a 90% chance of rain and it did indeed rain the entire time. We were soaked down to the bone and the tour guide told us that they didn't cancel because there were too many people doing it that day, i.e. they didn't want to lose all that money. So instead we suffered and it was miserable. The only redeeming quality is that the wines at the first vineyard were awesome. Other than that, the wines at the second vineyard were almost undrinkable (and I am not a wine snob- any old $10 bottle will do for me), and the food for lunch was probably the worst selection they could have chosen. There was literally not a single thing I could eat, so I just starved and my boyfriend was able to eat it and he said it was pretty gross. All in all, I wish I never would have purchased this Groupon.",Kelly B.,2,2,1
" June 27, 2016","One of the tour guides that was given a large piece of our tour last Friday was unprofessional, cursed, and didn't really know much about the wines that were being served at the second winery. He was, however, helpful during the ride. Seems to need more training with the leading of the tasting session before he should be let loose on a group of riders.",Jeff D.,1,1,1
" September 19, 2016","It was disorganized from the beginning. When we arrived, it took 30 minutes to gather the group of 15 together. There were no snacks or pairings all day during the tasting. Lunch were deli sandwiches. At the second and final tasting, the winery was not set up for us so we waited 20 minutes in the heat before we began. The demonstrator knew little of the wines we were tasting and overall a very dull experience.",Matt R.,1,1,1
" August 18, 2016","It was a lot more bike than wine and your trip starts with a contract that says you have to wear a helmet and can't get drunk. We went to two wineries. The first one was great, the second one was not. We rode ten miles a had to stop every mile for the guide to make us hydrate. Pour and pedal is great for older couples not anyone under 60.  Safety is important but the regulations wrecked the trip.",Tom D.,1,3,2
" July 10, 2016",Not for non athletic people. Several people got lost and others couldn't keep up to the guides pace. The wineries were nice but wish we would have more one on one time with one of the wineries employees who actually knew more about the wines than the pour and pedal guides.,John S.,1,7,3
" July 10, 2016","First winery was quaint and the owner met with us and gave us a guided tour and explained the different grapes and what was in each bottle. Whereas the other more commercial extravagant winery was a dull reception. No commentary from pedal and pour guide who actually works at that winery except, "" they don't tell us what is in the bottles; it's more of a laboratory than anything else"". The cycling was difficult, several people got lost. We waited almost and hour for them and then we decided to go on as someone in a car was out looking for them. They took a different route and got there before us. This tour was not flat!!!  Hills that you coasted down at over 30 mph!!!!  That is not small rolling hills. All in all, the tour is a great idea, guides could have been better prepared with walki-Talkis or something, and they should have a private tasting with a representative of the winery. This is not a cheap ticket. I would just ride my own bike next time and pay the tasting fee at each winery.",John S.,1,7,3
