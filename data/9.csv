" January 18, 2019",Cool atmosphere and good food and drinks.  Love their happy hour bar menu!,Jill W.,5,9,7
" February 22, 2019",The food and prices are outstanding. The only negative experience that I encountered during my meal was the service. The waitress was so engrossed in the gossip conversation she was having with non-customers that service was sporadic at best. Not to mention it was snowing and no one else was in the establishment. It shouldn‚Äôt have been that hard to receive service from someone 10 feet away.,Michael F.,3,4,1
" August 30, 2018","they were extremely restrictive.  for 20.00 for brunch, the menu was too limited.

" January 6, 2019",It wasn‚Äôt all that to me. I took my boyfriend here to start off his birthday . The server we had she didn‚Äôt know anything and she have to  ask the other servers for help. Then after I had to let them correct my bill first  and they was charging me for stuff I didn‚Äôt have at all.  The waitress had the nerves to send someone to ask me if I want my change smh.  I wouldn‚Äôt be going back at all.,Naiema D.,1,3,2

" April 8, 2017","Unfortunately this place didn't love up to our expectations from our last visit. We had really enjoyed this little place it has a cool, modern vibe. The food was average but overpriced, the server wasn't attentive, and his hands reeked of cigarettes. The highlight of our experience was the drinks, all three were great.

" July 15, 2016","I never give bad reviews. It wasn't bad just a little frustrating. It took the bartender 20 minutes to figure out how to use or if he can accept the Groupon...maybe I was the 1st to use it. The drinks came quick but it took the food another 30 minutes. üòê I just ordered wings and fries, which I would have understood if it was busy but there was only 1 other patron there.

 Invalid date,"Sit in the bar area, the wait staff tends to 'get lost' much less there.  We've found the food to be excellent but the wait staff not well trained.   And the wait for a couple of omelettes when the restaurant was not even 30% full, was interminable.  Also, the dining room was understaffed.   There should have been at least 2 wait persons for the 8 tables.",James A.,5,20,18

 Invalid date,"We enjoyed our dining experience but thought the Groupon restrictions were very limiting.  For example, the soup/appetizer was limited to $6 making only one menu choice available.  The entree was limited to $14 making most of the menu items prohibited.  Fortunately, you allowed us to pay the difference and order the more expensive items.  Otherwise, everything else was quite nice.",Howard J.,5,30,21

 Invalid date,MK is a neighborhood hangout mainly for drinks and music but the GROUPON was for the bar menu only which is where we sat. I assume there was also a dining room. There was DJ music. The $12 specialty drinks were too pricy for what we got. The standard $8 cocktails were better priced. The food was OK... we tried four appetizers. The sliced short ribs was excellent the other appetizers OK,James H.,5,7,5

 Invalid date,"The food was very very good. The service was OK. The waitstaff could be either more organized or better trained at handling a number of tables. They were pretty busy when I was there, which is a great sign they are doing well.",M P.,5,3,3

 Invalid date,"We really enjoyed our meal, Ben was a wonderful server. Thank you and we will be back with more friends.",Vicky P.,5,5,2
 Invalid date,"Please know that the man going from table to table introducing himself as the restaurant's designer and handing out business cards was not only intrusive and a bit lacking in class, but kind of bizarre...the restaurant must work on not selling itself so hard to customers who are already eating there!",Mark D.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,"If you do not like noise, go when you can dine in their lovely garden.",Helene S.,5,18,10
 Invalid date,"We ordered three Prime rib steaks that were cooked as requested however if you say a steak is bone in it should be bone in.   also the third person ordered Salmon which the waiter said came with (mixed/or grilled?) veggies and couscous. there were peas in the couscous and no veggies.  The couscous was sent back because she doesn't eat peas.  when returned I noticed there were still peas on the plate.  were the peas picked out?  If there is a next time  replace or offer something else.  One can have obstacles that when handled appropriately making the overall expirience good.  MK Valencia went out of their way to correct wrong, to get it right and I appreciated this above all.  Dr. J.",Vadnee J.,5,10,8
 Invalid date,"Service was excellent, food delicious and. Nice atmosphere!",Deb C.,5,6,4
 Invalid date,Not only was the food great the staff was pleasant.  We had an issue with our Groupon initially and they treated us very professionally and so nice which is why I have personally recommended it to at least 8 people.  Two ot them have already gone and loved it as well!!  Good Job!,Catherine S.,5,1,1

 Invalid date,Our service was painfully slow - Friday @ 8pm.,Brian P.,5,5,3
 Invalid date,"Just because you are asking..... We found that there was a lot of noise, especially from a private party across the way. I guess that's the only place to have group of people? It got to the point, it was hard to hear our conversation. Also, maybe done on purpose, but there was no salt, or butter on the table. Bread was delicious, would have liked some butter, besides the olive oil. These things were just a few things I notices, the rest of us, didn't say anything.",Eva S.,5,6,3
 Invalid date,excellent waiters,Julete K.,5,9,9

 Invalid date,service was slow at the end. I was going to get desert but it took so long for the server to get back to us that I just asked for the check. Everything else was wonderful.,Pat P.,5,17,14
 Invalid date,"Food was excellent, service was amazing, Ben our server and Arthur & Robert were GREAT, restaurant was beautiful and atmosphere makes this place a needed HOME RUN in this area.  This is a NYC hidden gem in Ridgefield Park.",Alan P.,5,12,8
 Invalid date,"Maco shark was superb!!!  The venue is hip and beautifully designed.  And there's an outdoor area that is just perfect for a romantic dinner or dinner with friends...Nice wine list, too!",Arlene S.,5,8,7
 Invalid date,Little noisy but good food and service,John P.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,"Very friendly atmosphere, the restaurant's appearance should be in Manhattan.  Very friendly staff.  The presentation of the food is like out of a magazine!!!",Gene B.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,"Service was attentive, food was fine, but ambience could be improved upon. Perhaps Sunday evening is particularly slow, but the feeling was that this restaurant is too big, and has attracted too little interest.",Charles G.,5,5,3
 Invalid date,superb service,Robyn M.,5,9,5
 Invalid date,Would love to see more vegetarian options on the menu.,Sandra V.,5,19,6
 Invalid date,everything very nice.  Service was great,JINKWON K.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,We will be back!,Stephanie B.,5,34,20
 Invalid date,"it's nice to have waitstaff inquire as to how things are--BUT
not too frequently",Susan F.,5,3,3
 Invalid date,Great place!  The decor is beautiful.   The food is very good. Our waitess Megan was very sweet!,Sherry G.,5,2,2
 Invalid date,"The food was good, but nothing to write home about and the wine list is poor.  The cocktail selection is poor and too sweet, which explains the bartender's heavy hand with the sugar in a mojito.  The bar shouldn't run out of any booze, especially Cachaca when Caipirinha is on the drink menu.  The service was good, but the waiter didn't seem to know the ingredients that well.  Although it's a pretty restaurant (looks like a SoHo place), the location is poor.  I can go into the city, Edgewater, Englewood, or Hoboken for much better food.",John F.,1,14,13
 Invalid date,"A great place, very trendy. We enjoyed our dinner and drinks, the service was good.",Anthony V.,1,3,3
 Invalid date,Wait staff should be more professional for the pricey menu.,Sherrie C.,1,83,39
 Invalid date,"I had a miscommunication with my waiter. I had confirmed that the Groupon was good for an entree up to $19.  I ordered a cobb salad that was $10 and shrimp that were $6 (in my mind, that was a $16 order, which is well under the $19 limit).  But I had to pay $6 for the shrimp (and there were only 3 shrimp).  I would have ordered something else if that had been made clear to me. So unfortunately that left me with a bad feeling that I did not get the value from this groupon.",Julie,1,16,9
 Invalid date,We had to get up to ask for some salt.  We requested Hollandaise Sauce for the steak and eggs; we did not get it.,Marian S.,1,31,24
 Invalid date,"Pay $25 for $30 worth of food. If you don't drink the choice are VERY limited
Including only white bread",Murray F.,1,25,12
 Invalid date,"It took almost 20 minutes for someone to come over to give us menu's. Once the waiter came over he was really helpful. Overall I don't think I will return, the outdoor area was very solemn. They should have some sort of light or soft music playing. It was ok, but not great. I would not have paid full price for the service/food.",Ray M.,1,11,5
 Invalid date,service was great the food was not that great,Jessie,1,11,3
 Invalid date,"The food was very good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a pricey restaurant.  The value of the Groupon was not that good, appetizers were up to $6.oo and Entres up to $14.00.  There were that many choices with those prices.  I got the same salad with my crab cakes than with my salmon entre.  The decor is first class.",Edgar C.,1,48,35
 Invalid date,"Service left much to be desired.  The waiters could at least greet you with a smile and sound upbeat rather than stoic and appear like they wanted to be somewhere else. I ordered a coffee and the waiter did not bring cream. I asked for some and waited, and waited and waited. Finally, had to ask the other server and waited some more.  Without Groupon, the value is not there.",Lee H.,1,15,6
 Invalid date,"The server was incredibly rude and tried to rip us off. The groupon said it's value was for appetizers up to $7.The cheapest appetizer on the menu was priced at $8. When we told him we had a groupon first he said ""you can use that towards a purchase and pay the additional $$"" We requested to speak with management and his story changed. Suddenly there was a bar menu we could choose from with lower prices. The rest of the night he made it seem like he was doing us a favor by allowing us to use the correct menu and the service was very slow.",Ashley S.,1,2,1
 Invalid date,They had  a Margarita pizza that was the worst i have ever had. I have had better frozen pizza from a store. The Martini's were served in a small glass. What is management thinking.  We will never go back.,Theodore P.,1,8,4
 Invalid date,The restaurant had HORRIBLE service with the groupon because the groupon allows u to sit only in the lounge area. After receiving horrible service we complained to the owner and manager who then proceeded to tell us that seating in the lounge area doesnt come with waiter service. The owner and manager were very rude when we expressed our disappointment. Will never go back to this establishment.,Natalie N.,1,2,1
 Invalid date,Food was not fresh!!!,Michele C.,1,30,12
 Invalid date,"The service was awful. We had to ask for everything menu, napkins, silverware and our order. It was a shame because the decor was very trendy and upscale.",Alexandra N.,1,8,5
 Invalid date,"Very rude, Did not honor the Groupon untill we fought with them. Asked to see the manager and after 10 minutes of waiting the waiter came over and honored the groupon. Prices were extremely high. I will stick with going to Lukas.",Brian A.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"Groupon was a great opportunity to try the restaurant - the food and menu choices were very good as were the portions. The fried seafood appetizer was outstanding - kudos!  The server was professional, but a bit overbearing. There is a fine balance between good service and doting overinvolvement.  I don't know if I would return because we were ""nickled and dimed"" re. what was included on the Groupon. e.g. entrees up to 30 -  I had rack of lamb - so you made another $4. - tacky. We were surprised at the choice of wine included in the Groupon.  In fact, it was surprising that a wine of such inferior quality is your house wine.",Carol S.,1,73,40
 Invalid date,"Our waiter brought me the wrong dish. I ate it anyway, but he didn't offer anything other than an apology. Then, I needed to pull the car over for an emergency bathroom break not too long after that. Horrible experience. Can't recommend it and would not go back.",Phil N.,1,4,1
 Invalid date,"Place very pretty but extremely loud.  Acoustics need improvement.  Restaurant not full when there but hard to hear person next to me.  Service ok but needed to ask twice for butter, to ask for plates to share an appetizer and it was just slow.  Food tasty.  Parking extremely difficult to find.",Karen G.,1,10,5
 Invalid date,"Food, ambiance, employees are all fabulous!  Love it..",Lynn D.,1,11,6
 Invalid date,"The location is very stylish and comfortable.  However, dinner was average and the drink we ordered was poorly made.  We had to stir it for a good 10 mins for all the sugar to be disolved.  The bartender seemed to be having a bad day or something because everyone kept looking towards the bar everytime a bottle sounded like it was being smashed.  Our waiter even apologized for the delay in the drink being made and all the noise.",Alejandro V.,1,24,21
 Invalid date,the food needed seasoning. It was tasteless. Nice place for drinks.,Michelle Q.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,I had raviolis and the portion seemed way too small. For $17 I would expect to not be hungry. And I also had to wait a long time for everything! I felt like the waiter totally forgot about us. Annoying since the tables around us were being served promptly.,Jessica H.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"The servers need to completely describe a dish.  A veal chop was described as pan seared, not breaded.  Potato wrapped fish should be drained completely on a towel before serving.  The crust on the apricot and peach crisp was totally raw.  With a pastry chef on the premises this was unappealing, since there need be no crust in a crisp type dessert, just a crisp topping.  There was a large party and the noise was deafening.  The place is really attractive, great finishes and attention to detail.   I just think they need pay more attention to the way their food is prepared and presented.",Susan A.,1,65,39
