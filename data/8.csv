" December 31, 2018","Have attended this event three times in the past. The event was particularly unorganized this year with long wait times at each station. Event organizers did not assist to remedy the situation, seemed unprepared for the crowds and generally unaffected by the customer complaints during the event. It‚Äôs sad as the wines are typically very good.",Lisa Y.,3,4,3

" June 5, 2018","Millbrook Winery a few short years ago was an enjoyable day out at a quaint winery with really good wine, and beautiful views. The past 2 years or so, it's become over crowded, loud and people often bring their dogs as well as their children. A winery, (especially one that serves food) is no place for dogs/pets (and I am a dog lover) and it will always baffle me as to why people bring their children to a place that has no entertainment for children. Its still a beautiful place, with great views and tours, and very good wines and the staff is always top notch, polite and helpful. It's just not our ""go to"" winery for a nice relaxing, adult day out anymore.",Rita M.,3,4,2

" July 16, 2016","Major renovations since last year, some still in progress.  

Short discussion out by the vines is informative, and it's fun to come at different times to see the cycle.  

Tour of original lift area turned art gallery is interesting (the art is an annual competition for new labels).

Down the back stairs to the winery, where the processes for whites and reds are explained, and the barrels, tanks, and other tools are introduced.  

Into the bottling room where that process is discussed, including how cork is harvested.  

Then back to the tasting room.  Several nice wines.  There are two 'levels' of tastings; the more expensive is only done Thursday - Sunday.  

Grab the Groupon - the tasting price is definitely aimed for ""the City pockrtbook.""",Carol L.,5,17,16

 Invalid date,"beautiful setting, great tour - however, hospitality was on the fence, I felt some staff were passive agressive and demeaning when we first walked in and wanted to show our Groupon for payment proof. We also did not get a sovenier wine glass (although called and had them sent to us) and did not offer any solution to the problem and did not want to deal with it. I also misplaced my wineglass from the tasting and when it came time to get our complimentary glass the host was reluctant to give us a new glass, guests come first! You cannot be at a winery and say you are short on glasses. tour guide was great (a little more enthusiam would have been great) overall I was pleased, but refrained from asking questions as I felt uncomfortable. Wine was great and I learned so many things I never knew!",Deanna H.,5,1,1
 Invalid date,Millbrook Winery is beautiful.  We had such a nice time hearing about the process of wine making.

 Invalid date,"Had a nice time at the winery. Was a bit disappointed with the shuttle as we were at the station and the shuttle left without us. Were told that it would be back in about 45 minutes, didn't arrive for an hour and half then was made to wait for the next departure which was another 30-40 minutes.

" March 5, 2017","We went during a Valentine's day ""red wine only"" event, and called ahead of time to see if we could do a normal wine tasting with our Groupon. We were told yes, and even sold additional tickets for our group when we arrived and asked again about a regular ref-white tasting. When the tasting started, we were told it was only reds (although we were told otherwise TWICE). The woman doing our tasting offered us whites because there was a mixup, then her manager came over and told her INFRONT of our group and the entire group tasting that they are too busy to accommodate stupid requests. We were so embarrassed, I will never go there again.",Courtney J.,1,7,1
" February 1, 2017","We took a tour... but it was from a college kid who did not know much about wine and didn't work in the wine making process. So any auxiliary questions asked were not going to be answered. 

The wine was not my favorite. We did like the Hunter Red Wine a lot. 

The view was nice, especially if you go across the vineyard to gain some higher elevation.",Luke G.,2,1,1
" March 1, 2016",The Groupon was sold 11/29 without telling people that the tastings are not done over the winter  I went to use it in February only to discover I could not and that the Groupon would expire before the tastings resume. Very poorly done By both Groupon and the winery,Judith P.,1,6,1
" November 24, 2015","Wine tasting area was noisy, contemplate breaking the groups in separate areas The person conducting the wine tasting needs to have more flair and make it more enjoyable",Vandana D.,1,1,1

 Invalid date,"Not very good wine, but the place is nice.",Luciana R.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"Although the grounds and building were beautiful the tastings were chosen by the winery and they were all dry...I would have liked more variety and when I asked for a taste of something I thought sounded nice in the description I was denied because they did not have a bottle of that variety opened at the time. I had to ask for water and the ""snacks"" were not offered until the end rather than pairing them with the wines. First winery I have ever walked away from empty handed.",Christina H.,1,7,7
 Invalid date,Staff was not very friendly. Tour was very short and wine teasting even shorter,Priscilla M.,1,73,31
 Invalid date,Wine overpriced....let customers pick the wine they want to taste,Julie P.,1,3,2
