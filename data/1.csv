" September 19, 2016","I had really high hopes for the wine and cheese class I read so many great reviews and my friend who came with me had been to the craft beer tasting 2 years ago and said it was amazing.  Unfortunately, this event was such a let down and my friend and I were so disappointed. Robert, the owner, gave a pretty bravado 10 minute speech in the beginning about how he modeled the class off of NYC tastings he attended.  He said he wanted to sway our opinions on certain types of wines, which I was eager to see him try to do. But we quickly realized he was just all talk that night. 1) the only information we received on the wine we were drinking and what kind of cheese to try it with was from a printed handout, rather than from the mouth of the expert who was standing right there.  2) We were given four pretty basic types of cheese all at once, and their quality was sup-par. 3) the splashes of wine we got every 20-25 minutes were just alright, but nothing that interesting or unique.  4)Robert was not in the room most of the night and seemed really distracted. After sensing our disappointment with the whole experience, he proceeded to make a few different excuses as to why it was an ""off"" night for him. I'm sorry, I understand life happens, but I work in customer service too, and if someone spent $50 of their hard earned money on me I would try to give them the quality and experience they deserved. The whole evening felt half-assed, and I think some of the other people felt it as well.  I was expecting an interesting, fact filled 2 hours, where I would try new types of wine and cheese.  What little we got was so far from that.  I hope real NYC tastings are nothing like this.  The next day I got an apology text from Robert which pretty much perfectly sums up the evening.",Carly M.,2,11,9,1,"hopes,wine,class","great,amazing,disappointed"
" February 15, 2016",SCAM. The discount is a LIE. They lied to Groupon and to YOU about their normal price  so as to appear that you were getting a greater discount than what is available to any other retail customer.,Scott M.,1,2,2,1,"discount,groupon,price","normal,greater"
 Invalid date,"Very grossed out when bar tender/ lecturer rinsed her own glass wwith clear water ( no soap) for us to use. She also didn't know a lot about wine, wasn't at all professional. First wine tasting I've been to which didn't make glasses or bottles of water available. The cheese ""pairings"" were a small plate of cubed cheeses. There were price tags on the bottom of the wine glasses. Very disappointed and the wines were pretty bad.",Cary D.,1,1,1,0,"water,wine","professional,disappointed"
" July 18, 2017","Offered less than half of the beers on the ""tasting list.""  Rob did not have enough of 1 of the beers for our group to taste so poured out the remaining beer from a previous bottle we sampled as the solution rather than offer alternative options.  Alagash White, an Ithaca beer and Sierra Nevada were what he chose for the group.  Nothing not typically found at the grocery store.",Ross B.,2,1,1,0,"beers,options",alternative

 Invalid date,"The photo presented in no way represents what you actually receive.  The photo show's what appears to be international cheese as opposed to what you actually get which is very cheap american cheeses. Muenster, sharp cheddar and pepper jack. There were no olives or grapes like the photo presents.  Paid $109 for 4 people. That's $27 pp.  Such a rip-off!  This tasting is worth $15 dollars max. In the ad it is presented as a $240. value for 4 people. Get OUT OF TOWN! Such a joke! That's crazy! 
I should receive a full refund but in this case I will accept a 50% refund since the wines were ok. Misrepresentation.

 Invalid date,"I was extremely excited to try this experience out with my friends. The concept was great, the space was great, but the experience was terrible. There was no explanation of how the night was going to go. English was definitely not the ""instructors"" native language so it was really hard to understand what he was saying. There was no enthusiasm in the whole experience. I would definitely not recommend this experience to anyone since it was extremely boring and uneventful.",Francis S.,1,1,1,0,"experience,concept,space","great,terrible"
 Invalid date,"First off, the place does not have a professional feel; it feels like someone's home living room.  More importantly, for the service that was provided, even ~$30 per person was overpriced (and the normal price is apparently ~$100 per person).  At bars that provide them, I can get two flights that add up to more beer than was served during the tasting and it would still be cheaper than the Groupon price.  Don't get me wrong, the variety and selection of craft brews served was great; however, it is absolutely not worth the prices they're charging.  I've gone to exceptional whisky tastings (top shelf stuff) that serve a gourmet meal with the tasting and even they only charge $50-70 per person.",Chris Z.,1,1,1,0,"place,feel,serivce","professional,overpriced"
