" August 10, 2018","The cruise was fun, sexy and the night lights of NY & NJ were a sight to behold. The boat was not overcrowded though some people had standing due to limited seating. I did however go to the wrong marina to one of MBS’s other cruises. I thought I read carefully but maybe not...  so be careful u know which marina in this case it was Battery Park. I will be going on another cruise for sure.",Dawn M.,5,3,3
