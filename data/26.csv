" December 13, 2018","Bad experience, the owner did not honor my groupon because she stated I was not a new customer and that I could pay the difference. The groupon states if you have not been there in the last six months in which I had not.  I was told she was not responsible for what it says??

I went to see Josh because I was his customer at another salon and he is wonderful and that is the only reason why I gave it 3 stars.  I will never go back, poor customer service, did not even offer any type of compromise so I said I will only get color not to owe additional monies.",Lisa,3,1,1
" October 29, 2018","It was my first time going here, right before a trip to Atlantic City. I had a 10 am appointment with Josh. First, this place is so well decorated and homey. Josh offered me coffee and water, which is a nice little perk. Josh is an amazing stylist and made me feel comfortable, especially when I asked questions about the best style for me. I left feeling fabulous and so happy with my haircut.",Elena R.,5,1,1

" March 15, 2019","I don‚Äôt get my hair cut often because it grows very slowly.
I usually get a groupon once a year. But, I am never all that happy. Josh was awesome!
He cut just enough to give it shape and body. He seemed to be a very happy person, smiling often toward his coworkers. He was friendly, but not overly chatty!
I think I found my guy!
I highly recommend him!",Heidi G.,5,10,2

" August 3, 2018","I was in search for a new salon closer to where I live now, and was in desperate need of a cut and color. Bought Groupon, called salon and had an appt the next morning! Joshua was wonderful; he communicated his thoughts, asked me for pictures of likes, and gave me a great cut and color. Bought their blow out package and have found my new hair guy!",Ruth H.,5,3,3
" August 2, 2018","Very casual and friendly. The stylist joked a bit and did a pretty good job w the cut. The place has an open feel and modern in design. 
It's close by and right off of Hamburg turnpike. Would go again if the price was as good initially. I think a thirty minute haircut  is on the overpriced 
Side  without the group on I believe it ran fifty or fifty five for women's hair.
I mean we are not in Ridgewood or Wayne where u come to expect that cost factor. Which can happen if u don't know ur prices.",Melissa F.,4,9,9

" September 28, 2018","I had a half head of highlights done by Josh, and I'd never return. While my experience at the salon was quite pleasant, it wasn't until I returned home and thoroughly inspected my hair that I found a horizontal line of pure bleach that is impossible to miss. I'm embarrassed and saddened that this wasn't rectified during the appointment. Instead, my hair was styled in a way to conceal the mistake.",Kayla R.,1,4,2
" May 26, 2018","Josh was excellent! Very good customer service and will definitely be returning! 
Thank you.",Tina P.,5,2,2
" May 21, 2018",Really liked this salon. Nikki was very helpful and listened when I told her what I was looking for.  Was glad that she took care to make sure she used a processor that wouldn‚Äôt damage my fragile hair. They don‚Äôt try to nickel and dime you either which I appreciated.  The salon is pretty and cozy and the wait time was next to nothing.  I think I finally found a salon I will stick with.,Laura M.,4,13,5

" November 7, 2017","Terrible, stay away",Jane A.,1,6,2
" February 27, 2017","The stylist took over 40 minutes to create the most uneven and sadly looking haircut I've ever had. 
From the get go her lack of experience was clear. And as much as I felt bad offending her, I simply could not leave the place looking like a mess and had to approach the owner and have her fix it. 
Never again!",Dr. T.,1,28,17
