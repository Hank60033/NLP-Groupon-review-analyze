" October 5, 2018","Great time with great brews!  Friendly staff they offered to swap the Groupon deal with the free growler for a free pint glass of theirs or a free pint of beer on them which was cool cause some people have a lot of growlers already.  Great selection of beer which is always good cause not everyone enjoys the same beer.  The bartender was very friendly and very knowledgeable on the beer as well as the beer process which is always a plus! The building appears to be an old bank given the tiled ceiling and volt door they have in there.  The high ceilings seem to increase the notice level so if your looking for a quiet nook this isn't your place.  I would say it's not really kid friendly given how it's set up.  Very enjoyable time and I would reccomend keeping this on your list of things to do in Hackettstown, nj",Aaron P.,5,1,1

" May 12, 2018","We went on a Thurs nite....poor customer service for our first ( and last visit) no tour, handed a paper with 9 beers listed to ""guess"" what we would like. Bar tender was too busy drinking with group eating around the bar. Too many good breweries in the area to be treated like this...",Wendy O.,1,10,10
" May 11, 2018","Sorry to say we were very unhappy here and will not return.  We sat at our table and approached the guy behind the bar (Danny) who said he would come and explain the beers they had.  He never came after fifteen or twenty minutes.  Well, after sitting at the table waiting for him to come and explain to the four of us.  I decided to stand up and go stand at the bar he then came to me and asked what beer, I wanted.  I said we all would like him to explain the beers that he had.  Well, he half hardly explained and my one friend got up to listen but our wives felt put off and did not bother so we listened and got our flights and returned to our table.  I am sorry to say we felt that the staff here were too busy socializing with other people that apparently are regulars.  We felt very put off by this staff from the minute we walked in.  Maybe this place is hoping to survive by having regulars show up because they are not very friendly to newbies showing up.  I want to support local business and am all for these local breweries but they better hire a more friendly staff if they expect repeat business.  I was not impressed by their beers, especially if I have to engage the staff in telling me about them.  I will not return to the Man Skirt.",Linda M.,2,3,1

We had a good time.  The Groupon we used provided 2 growlers, and you can have them filled for a reasonable fee, or being them back other times to be filled.

 Invalid date,"We had a fun time trying out the different beers they had on tap.  My only disappointment was that a brewery tour was offered on the Groupon and when we presented it, we were told, ""well, there it is."" All the brewery tanks were along the right hand side of the wall. We were told the Brew master was busy in back and would be out later if we had questions.  I was expecting more of an explanation of the process of beer making and how they develop different brews.  My husband didn't think a thing about not having a proper tour.  All he cared about was sampling the delicious, fresh beers. We loved their beers so much we bought some to bring home in our complimentary glowler. I would recommend this Groupon.",Valerie N.,4,7,7

I tried the Better than Pants, the Oktoberfest, and another that I forgot.I liked what I had. We later went to the Oktoberfest at the L.V. Brew Pub where I tried another Oktoberfest beer.

The environment was relaxed, and everyone was so friendly! The only thing to note is that the Groupon for ""2 growlers"" covers the cost of the glass growlers, not to be filled.",Stephanie F.,5,3,3

" January 25, 2017",Friendly bartender/owners. Great beer. Relaxed atmosphere. They don't serve food but you can bring in take out from local restaurants (Marley's is my favorite) & eat it there while trying a taste of every beer they currently have. The amount of seating is for only about 30-40 people total so don't bring a huge group but our group of 4 was fine. We were there from about 7:30-9 on a Saturday night.,Colleen G.,5,17,13

" April 7, 2017","I got this Groupon for my fianc√© and the beer was incredible, but unfortunately the growlers do not come filled, which was a disappointment to us, because we had to pay to fill them, and the tour wasn't anything really you had to ask, it's hard to say it was worth the money.",Jesica Alfinito K.,2,3,2
