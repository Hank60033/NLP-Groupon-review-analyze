" June 3, 2018","I haven't gotten in very far yet with the class but so far everything is wonderful! It's great information and easy to do either on a computer or a mobile device, which I thought rocked!!! I'm very happy I choose to do this !!",Meg H.,5,2,2
" July 31, 2018","It was a good course.  I wish it was recognized by the state as a licensed and approved bartender class, but unfortunately it isn't.",David F.,4,10,6
" September 13, 2018",This course was informative..wish it included a certificate rather than having to pay extra for it.,Christy C.,4,7,2
" December 9, 2018","This course was Awesome!!! It was so inexpensive and I learned so much. They cover everything you could possibly need to know to become a bartender. And not just an adequate bartender or barista, but a really great one!!! I would highly recommend this course to anyone, whether they are considering this as a career, or to sharpen their skills if they are already working in the field. For me, it was just an all-around great experience.",Sheryl B.,5,4,1
" October 17, 2018","I learned a lot about the profession, but you really need a hands on course to be the best.  This course will give you the basics and help you get on the right path.  I am now considering a local bartender school for the learning experience.",William B.,4,1,1
" March 11, 2019","The class was great. So much information and it was organized nicely, and the quizzes were short multiple choice or true/false questions. My only complaint is that the groupon only includes the class and the option to buy the certificates at the end. So, extra money has to be spent if you want proof of taking the class (such as certificate, transcripts, etc).",Jacqueline G.,5,5,4
" December 16, 2018",How do I redeem this for a gift I have two more to do too?,Bert S.,4,1,1
" July 10, 2018","A helpful course, but its very dry and the information isn't presently very nicely...  seems like the course was copy/pasted from a word document. You also have to pay for everything every step of the way. Once you pass your course there's a fee to get an online certificate in PDF form ($6.50 Canadian) and to get a hardcopy form (19.99- ridiculous). I won't be taking another course from them.",Rebecca F.,3,1,1
" October 4, 2018","The course itself was great, trying to get a gig after is the hard part",Ebonie C.,5,2,2
" April 1, 2019","Getting started was a little confusing, trying to get to the web page from veiwing the voucher would always read an error. I had to go to the vendor's page to get started, after that it all was very informative and easy to follow. The Groupon price is amasing for the training and certifacate.",Rodrigo A.,4,1,1
" March 22, 2019","I have had an excellent experience with this company.

The Co. has lots of courses, check them out.",Jason P.,5,1,1
" September 24, 2018","A great course with lots of detail and wisdom about what it means to be a bartender and barista, taking in the context of the entire bar, coffee shop, and business. Unfortunately, I didn't expect it to be so reading heavy. Videos which explained some of the process and, for example, visibly showed different tools in the bar would've made it much easier and much less of an eyesore on weekday nights. It's a great course if you learn well by reading, otherwise brace yourself.",David C.,4,1,1

" September 21, 2018",Well because I was never able to sign into the class I‚Äôd have to say not only was I disappointed but also extremely frustrated by the entire process. I only gave this one star because I am unable to submit my post unless I post something for this coarse,Karen S.,1,3,2

" March 31, 2019",I think the two trainings didn't work together. There was no transition piece. One moment you are tending bar then BAM you are learning about coffee beans. Felt very disconnected. Otherwise was not a bad course. Don't think I can go be a bartender now though.,Suzanne M.,4,6,3

No instructor, no videos, nothing else.  You could probably find all the information elsewhere for free, minus the quizzes.

" April 28, 2016","This online ""training"" is so bad that I feel embarrassed of myself after wasting my money on it. It's a manually driven slideshow with some information and pics that you can easily find in the web for free. On top of that, once you finish they'll ask you to pay extra money in case you want to print a competition certificate. 

If it cannot considered as a robbery, then it's only one step close.",Efren R.,1,1,2

I recommend furthering the education on you-tube for mixing drinks and etching coffee drinks.",Eric R.,5,3,2
" January 5, 2017","The course was very well written and the exams were on point with the material.

I bought this for personal enjoyment, not to enhance a career, so I can't comment on whether or not the certificate actually allows you to advance in the field. The course was difficult to maneuver with both Safari and Chrome as the layout of the pages didn't flow properly and reading the pages wasn't always as simple as left-to-right. In addition, there are *a lot* of spelling and grammar errors that make some content difficult to understand.

" October 22, 2017","This course is filled with redundancy on top of redundancy. The process takes a ridiculous amount of time to complete simply because of the PowerPoint method of instruction. Each page is about 100 words or less. So finishing a section take forever sure to this layout. Many of these 100 words or less pages refer to this like having a fully stocked bar, or where the sink is in relation to the ice and cash till. The post of the course where it actually behind to discuss mixing is only after you've dedicated hours and hours to get through the opening rhetoric. Is unfortunate, but this course in the way it's currently laid out would take several months (best case scenario) to complete.",Tony,1,3,2
