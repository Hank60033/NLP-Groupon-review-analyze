" July 20, 2018","Although the crowd and atmosphere was great, I am giving them 1 star because of the service.  They have a Thursday night special for $5 pizza pies so we ordered 2 pies.  When we went to pay our final bill, we were told that they would not honor the $5 price, but would instead charge us full price for the pizzas just because we were using a Groupon.
