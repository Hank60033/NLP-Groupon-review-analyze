" September 9, 2018",The price we paid was an outstanding value. There were many excellent wineries present at the festival. All willing to present and explain their wines. Really good crowd of people to experience this event with. Free parking for the event. Highly recommended for any wine lovers or wine amateurs willing to taste the differences in the wine tasting experience.,Jonathan L.,5,3,2,1,1,0,1,1,0

" September 15, 2018",Excellent experience for the novice to a sommelier.  I brought a mixed group with me and everyone had different favorites.  Sellers were patient and knowledgeable.  Although it can get very crowded the atmosphere is festive and light.  There is a great selection.,Liz C.,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
" September 10, 2018","The variety of wines was wonderful from local wineries but to tout this as a ""Food & Wine Festival "" is very misleading. The ""food"" was cheese, dips, a other crudit茅s for sampling. At other food and wine festivals there was actual ""tastings"" by local chefs and/or restaurants. If you wanted something to eat you paid for something of a FOOD TRUCK",Marie S.,3,3,2,1,0,0,1,0,0

" September 10, 2018","The wine tasting wasn't bad. There was a good representation of NYS wineries and distilleries there and a good representation of food exhibitors with free samples. It was fairly easy access to the exhibitors and the tastings as it wasn't too crowded (went on Sunday per Groupon) and there weren't a lot of strollers. People are bringing there own wine caddies (ie, small pull along shopping carts) even though there is a very handy pickup service so you don't have to tote your wine purchases around. I had two main complaints. The wine offered for sale at the event was about 25% costlier than you would pay at a discount liquor store. The separate food vending area (not the food exhibitors) was extremely overpriced. I paid $6.00 for a small slice of pizza. Hot dogs sold for $4.00 apiece. I would expect a small premium on food but this was ridiculous. If I go again, I will bring my own food. Not sure if you can bring it in but one can always go to the car to eat.",Gary W.,3,7,6,1,1,1,1,0,0
" September 9, 2018",The Wine Fest is awesome.  You get to taste hundreds of wines and food and buy at discounted prices.  Getting the Groupon price to get it is the way to go.  Definitely recommend it.,Kelly C.,5,6,4,1,1,0,1,0,0

Everything was mixed together , wine, crafts, some food items which was nice. We had a great time trying wines that normally we would not have. There was a great selection from dry to semi dry to very sweet.  We came home with 21 bottles!  The second day was not as crowded,  some vendors had sold out of products we bought the day before but this is normal for a two day event.

" September 9, 2018",Nice venue but so so crowded. The one big issue is many of the vendors only had 2 staff. Once a purchase is made now there is only one person pouring.

This year I still paid extra to test the beers and it was in the food tent with as little as 5 or 6 beers to test.  Very disappointing.  I am very happy I took advantage of the savings at groupon for this, otherwise, I would have really been dissatisfied.  Also, the free Verizon bags were ripping and where people had placed their wine bottles that they purchased, fell out of the bags and were in danger of breaking on the pavement.

 Invalid date,When I checked out the site prior to purchasing the groupon it was rather misleading. The food prices were way to expensive. You could buy the little food coupons for a dollar a piece at the venue. It was said on the site that most of the food was between $1.00 - $5.00 when in reality the average lunch items were priced at $11.00. With all the wine samples I felt it was very irresponsible that the food prices were so outrageous. I had to forgo a lot of the wine samples because I could not afford more food and I did not want to become overly intoxicated.
