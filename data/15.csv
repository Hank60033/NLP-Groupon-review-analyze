" July 1, 2018","We loved this place. We were a group of 6 people. We got there a little early for our reservation, but we were welcomed in like family. We opted for the cheese plate which was a great option to pair with the wine. Then the wine tasting began and it moved at a very comfortable pace from dry to sweet. Great wines. We walked out with 6 bottles to take home. Highly recommend this experience.",Chuck C.,5,24,7

" June 26, 2018","They will give you a small sample of ALL of their (maybe 10-15!!!) wines.  Very large selection.  They DID say that you have to (I did not - they let me ""go"") call ahead and reserve, even with your Groupon, which actually is kind of a pain.  They said that it plainly states that on the Groupon, although I missed it.",Steven B.,5,3,2
" May 8, 2018","I thought our experience was a very good one, especially since my mom and brother had not been to a wine tasting before and we had not been to Plagidio's previously to know what to expect.

" September 8, 2016","Wish I learned more about the vineyard. And wish it was more organized. Kinda like a free-for-all, a bunch of people at a bar tasting tiny tiny samples from two bartenders. Doesn't have a vineyard feel at all.",Lauren E.,3,5,1

" January 25, 2018",The Experience was GREAT!! I do want to say you do not have to buy the tickets thru Groupon. We did but when we got there we found there was no money savings. The cost of the Tasting and the Cheese plate were the same amount if we did not use Groupon. I am not sure who sets the price (Groupon or the Winery). Either way I will be going back but will not need to use Groupon for the visit.,Jodie S D.,5,1,1

" February 11, 2018","I bought this groupon based on the great reviews I read, but it was a mediocre experience if that. The manager wasn't friendly and just rushed our check in and just told us to enter the wine tasting room without much instruction. They were very frugal with the wine pouring despite the small selections they had and the ""wine experts"" were more dry than the wine. It was disappointing so our complimentary return vouchers (part of the groupon deal) will either be given away or just tossed.",Nina G.,2,14,9
 Invalid date,Wine staff were very nice and helpful but the wine was not very good at all. There are far too many other good wineries (product wise) in the area especially within Hammonton alone. Quality service just not a good product,Jim O.,1,4,2

 Invalid date,There was no where to sit and young lady didn't bring out cheese and chocolate that was included with group on.,Cindy P.,1,3,3
