" March 5, 2019",Very nice set up in the middle of the Alsteade's farm market. Nice bonus to pick up so goodies to go along with the wine. The woman who ran the tasting was very friendly and knowledgable. I enjoyed the experience and will be back.,Toni S.,5,3,2
" August 29, 2018","It was a lot of fun sitting under the tent, sipping tastes of good wine and having fun conversation.",Rich M.,4,1,1
" October 26, 2018",Great staff and friendly atmosphere to enjoy a little wine!,Andrea P.,5,2,1
" March 4, 2019",Very nice experience & good value. Private tasting at a counter in a cute farm shop. Many good wines to choose from; tried some unique varietals. Knowledgeable & friendly wine guide. Includes year membership of 20% off wines!! No minimum (you don’t have to buy a case at a time.) 4 out of 5 stars because one of the 6 bottles we purchased had gone to vinegar sadly. But we would go back.,Colleen G.,4,16,12
" January 17, 2019",Great place !,Monica P.,5,3,1

" July 17, 2018",It was a nice set up they had at the farm. We did the tasting while enjoying the outside view and ended up buying a few bottles. Great price for the tasting too!,Marcia D.,5,17,9
" October 16, 2018",Awesome wine  found the winery inside too small and no chairs available,Ana M.,4,4,2
" October 14, 2018",I took a chance and bought this Groupon for my boyfriend and I to have a wine tasting experience in New Jersey.Tomasello Winery did not disappoint! It was a phenomenal experience. There is wine tasting outside or inside the farm store. Our wine stewardess helped us wine newbies getting into wine tasting and experimenting different flavors.Highly recommend Tomasello Winery at Alstede Farms!,Shorty S.,5,2,2

" August 22, 2018",Wine was great! Staff was very friendly and informative.,Leslie S.,5,2,1
" August 8, 2018",It was nice and pleasant but not at all but we thought a wine tasting would be. For us it was at the back of the farm store and there is no sitting area. We bought ourselves a $10 block of cheese to go.... I guess it might have been better if we were outside during the daytime hours. But it wasn't anywhere close to the vineyards that we are used to doing wine tastings at :) so don't expect that,Propa G.,4,7,4
" August 6, 2018","Great staff, wonderful wine!",Greg S.,5,12,6
" July 27, 2018","It was a fun experience, great Groupon value.  Their wine selection was delicious.",Janice L.,5,2,1
" July 16, 2018",It was a lot of fun and definitely worth the price; the weather wasn't the greatest so I would just try and schedule it on a nice day!,Monica C.,4,1,1
" June 25, 2018",Loved it! Loved the farm and LOVED the wine. Got a lot for with this groupon (I just wish they were a little heavier on the pours). But I would 100% go again,Victoria D.,5,4,3
" June 10, 2018",Fun little addition to a visit to the farm!,Susan G.,4,11,5
" February 11, 2019",Very poor presentation facility. Actually just a corner of a farm stop. No ambiance at all.,MICHAEL B.,1,3,2
" December 6, 2018",Not at all what expected. If I knew we would have been doing a wine tasting in a small Soave at a tiny counter I would have never bought this Groupon. I gave 2 stars because of the wine club included and because of the company I was with. Definitely disappointed in this wine tasting. Wine was ok.,Randi F.,2,1,1
" November 19, 2018","The grounds are nice, however the wine tasting area is so hectic. The counter is like 2 feet long and zero space for tasting.  No one was giving us the history of the wines, etc.  I felt rushed with so many people waiting.  Also you only get to taste 5 wines.  NOT worth the price.",Shahonna J.,2,7,5
" May 16, 2018","Great wine,great people,great membership....love,love,love it",Wendy O.,5,10,10
" August 23, 2018","I think the service was great, but this was a winery experience I wasn't expecting.It was much more casual than I thought, which was fine honestly...but what was shocking was the wine. My mom and I tried different wines, and we didn't like any of them. I'm not sure why, besides the fact that they were watery, or bland, or too sour/bitter. I'm not a somm, but I don't think this wine experience was worth partaking in.",Evelyn T.,2,1,1
" April 24, 2018","Went here for my bday.  Great atmosphere.  However when I went there was still snow outside. So we couldn’t do the wine tasting outside, and their outdoor heated room was occupied.  So we had to stand to do the wine tasting. I just wish they had an extra room for activities and I wish they would have explained the different types of wine, how they are made, and how to taste it and smell it.",Amathea D.,4,11,4
" January 22, 2018","Just Visited on Saturday 1/20/18 . My husband and I had a very nice visit and tasted some very nice wines . Maria was is a sweetheart very patient and helpful .. We love the Ranier Red .. Great with Beef . 
Thanks Maria",Laura K.,5,3,1
" August 11, 2017","Wine tasting was good. Decent selection of wines, customer service was excellent. One downside is that certain wines in the $20-$25+ range were excluded since its from a different winery. No mention of that on the groupon and therefore can only purchase wines up to $19-$20 and can't take advantage of entire groupon value. They might want to consider allowing customers to purchase an additional bottle and pay the difference.",Varghese M.,4,4,4
" February 13, 2018","The wine tasting was informative, especially for someone who doesn't know much about wine.  The server was easy to talk to and very friendly. Great deal for your money. Very delicious wine.",Fabian R.,5,1,1
" January 12, 2018",Great wine! Love the tasting and got to learn a great deal about the winery!,Stacy P.,4,9,4
" July 29, 2017",Women at Ideal Farm tasting Room were AMAZING!!!  Best wine tasting experience in a long time!!! Nice wines and OMGosh... what a DEAL!! I'll be back!!!,Kelly D.,5,9,2
" October 25, 2017",The women who worked behind the counter were very professional & knowledgeable about the different wines which made for an enjoyable afternoon.  The wines were very good & we were able to sit at a table to sample the wines in the shade.  It was a very warm day.,Barbara G.,5,21,15
" March 29, 2015","Our hostess was so knowledgeable and friendly! The wines were amazing, what a great day with my folks enjoying the farm!! Thanks!!!",Oscar R.,5,6,3

" October 9, 2017",Super fun day at the farm and Tomasello was the perfect touch!,Lisa S.,5,35,21
" October 3, 2017","The wine tasting experience for two was exactly what I expected.  We had the five wines, souvenir wine glass and one bottle of Tomasello wine each, a membership and $5 off voucher.  It was everything we expected for a good price.",Yanira R.,5,1,1
" September 10, 2017",It was great and well worth the price of the Groupon!,Jeanine,5,2,2
" July 25, 2017","Friendly staff, knowledgable hostess, larger than expected variety of wines.  Would have given it 5 stars except upon redeeming our vouchers for our free bottles of wine it turns out an entire line of their wines is excluded from the offer and this was never mentioned on any of the groupon information or fine print.  The restriction on the groupon was the value was up to $25, no other restrictions were listed.",Anneliese W.,3,9,9
" July 3, 2017",It is not what I am use to for a wine tasting. It is a counter in an square area and there was a line of 10 minutes to get your sample. If you are okay with that then it might work for you. The lady working there was very good and attentive.,Ines A.,3,36,34
" June 15, 2017",Enjoyable visit to farm and winery outlet. All the wines were terrific and the Groupon deal is amazing! We loved our visit and will be back soon.,James D.,5,2,1

" April 11, 2015",Try the BlackBerry fruit Wine delicious!!!!,Esperanza P.,5,3,1
" February 21, 2015",Knowledgeable staff! Fun experience,Jenn,5,3,2
" August 15, 2017","The wine is served out of a shed. When asking for a particular wine to taste, one server repeatedly said ""I wouldn't drink that if it was the last liquid on earth"". The servers did not seem to have much wine knowledge. The only reason I did not give it 1 star is because their club benefits seem decent and I may purchase some fruit wines from them. The rest of the wines were not very good.",Tammy W.,2,9,7
