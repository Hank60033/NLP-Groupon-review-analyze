Vinoco gave us such hard time for redeemed the groupon when we placed the dinner order to go via telephone. we explained and read the fine print on the groupon to them. after 10 mins, the manager from Vinoco ""approved"" the order. However, they gave us more hard time when we pick up the food. We presented a print out of groupon and was told it was not good enough. They insist to see a copy of e mail confirmation from groupon for this purchase which I never had to do so with other vendors. Vinoco acted like they do not wanted to accepted the groupon.

" August 19, 2016","So I finally got excited for finally a girls night out as it has been over a year of dinner and drinks. 

Found this place from Yelp and it showed good reviews - great thing was there was also a Groupon for this - I felt like a winner. 

Well 1st off I did not feel like a winner when we got there. The place had some people but for a Saturday it was definitely light. 

The waiter we had seemed very flustered and very aggressive when he spoke which is not what you want from a waiter. We asked for recomendations on which Sangria's tasted good and the comment was kind of rude.. Comment was similar to Well the Sangria has to be good since its on the top of the menu.. 

Umm well not everything on the top of the menu means its good... 

So I ordered the Red Sangria and my other girlfriends ordered the white.
When the drinks came - boy was the taste a hit in the face. Not sure if it was the apples or something but it was bad - the apples tasted like moldy dish towels and the wine had that hint of taste too. It was pretty bad - we downed it anyways because our rule was to never waste alcohol. 

After that drink i just stuck it out with an old fashion glass of red wine. 
My girlfriend decided to still get fancy and try a flight of white - which when she asked if it was good - he said Yeah its white wines and thats why its on our board.. 

We then just wondered if thats just his personality to be snarky.

Food wise - things ordered:

HAM & TRUFFLED MUSHROOM FLATBREAD - really good, definitely enjoyed this the most

Steak Roll - was pretty tasty as well

PARRILLADA BOARD - skewers were ok - an we think there was a sausage (Chorizo) skewer which lacked flavor in all ways - tasted like it was boiled to death and left in water to lose even more flavor. 

One other note. The Groupon I purchased stated very clearly ""$40 Value Worth of Tapas: Valid Any Day, Dinner Only"". When I showed it to him he said ok no problem, I need the Groupon now. I had no problem giving it to him but when I mentioned oh today is Saturday - buy 1 drink get the other 1/2 off - he said oh you don't get that promotion because your using Groupon...In my head I said Ummm WTF! The Groupon clearly states on TAPAS.... but I decided not to fight it as I wanted to have a good night.

I was really hoping to find a nice tapas place closer to me but i guess the search will still remain.

I would not be coming back as I know places that are much better and less expensive.",Robin,1,3,2,1

The pieces of chicken were very fatty and the chorizo was not a good chorizo, it was almost tasteless.

The service was good so that is the only reason why I gave 3 stars.",Jessica G.,3,10,2,0

 Invalid date,Will definitely return with friends.,,5,8,6,1
 Invalid date,We really liked the rustic and authentic feel. The only thing is that the waiter was getting confused with our order even though he had it written down so some other wait staff would come and confirm and check on us because there was a bit of a wait with every course even with wine. We did not mind and will come back.,Maia K.,5,3,3,1

 Invalid date,"There needs to be more people helping out. I saw that there was a manager doing everything. A manaher's job is to oversee things. The person who they choose to hire must be bilingual. There was a very hard working man bussing tables, and attempted to take orders, but spoke such little English that pointing to the menu was the most effective method of getting an order taken.
The food is great and the people all work so hard. There is a need for more employees though. Maybe someone to just answer phones.",Kirsten W.,5,3,3,1

" January 28, 2018",Food is mediocre. The store (or just the table we were at?) had a faint smell of the gym. Couldn't tolerate that aroma.,Laura W.,2,6,2,0
" March 21, 2017","It was a tough experience. Be very cautious if you have a food allergy. After having told the waiter that I was allergic to shrimp, I still received the dish with shrimp in it.

 Invalid date,I was extremely dissapointed with the service.  We waited 15 minutes and then had to ask for Hugo to come to our table to take our drink orders. Highly suggest adding another waiter or a bus boy.....,James C.,1,9,2,0
 Invalid date,Horrible service- waiter couldn't understand our order.  We did NOT receive the house tapas (supposed to be included with the purchase of the Groupon). Table of 4-ordered the 5 course tasting menu for $35.75/pp and received regular menu portion.,Chrisdon K.,1,1,1,0
 Invalid date,The servers were clueless. The food was terrible for the value barely got any food for the amount of money I spent. The sangria was horrible. The staff unprofessional. Will never go back.,Ali F.,1,10,4,0

 Invalid date,Everything was full of mayonnaise and thick gloppy sauce on top. There was not one dish served that you could actually taste the food. I  got nauseous after tasting two different bites. If you are serving quality food you dont need to hide it.,Kim A.,1,2,2,0
 Invalid date,The waiter claimed you had to announce when reservation was made that you had a Groupon even though that wasn't mentioned as a requisite. They didn't want to honor the $38 off but ended up giving a house tapas after check was issued.,Jeannette C.,1,10,3,0
 Invalid date,"Don't eat meat, diabetic. All seafood had sweet sauce. Didnt try to alter.Told were using Groupon made a comment. Were meeting friends for dessert, went elsewhere. Eat out frequently and love small local places...did not feel welcome.",Sandra,1,6,4,0

 Invalid date,The food selection is very limited.  We asked for dessert and were told they do not offer dessert. What was offered for the groupon was not served.  We did not receive the house tapas only the entrees we ordered(which in my opinion were more like an appetizer).  The portions are so small you are left hungry.  The service was terrible.  The tables are tiny and you are sitting practically on top of the next person.,Jennifer,1,1,1,0
