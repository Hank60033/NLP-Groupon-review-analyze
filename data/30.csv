" August 11, 2018","The food was good and the staff was friendly. It was a nice atmosphere. My biggest qualm is when I reflected, my waitress charged us approximately 35% in gratuity. While I never have a problem paying gratuity, it was not communicated that that would be automatically added to our bill. Additionally, I believe standard gratuity is between 18-22%. 35% is excessive and I feel taken advantage of.",Cadacia T.,3,11,8
" September 2, 2018","The ambience was nice and the staff were very attentive and friendly. My complaint is that on the Groupon itself it doesnt tell you that you'll be charged gratuity based OFF OF THE PRE-DISCOUNTED value, until AFTER you purchase the Groupon and there's a subsection under the redemption code. The food was eh. For the total spent, I'd go to a hibachi next time. Wine was budget wine, good to cook with",Ted M.,3,3,3
" August 13, 2018","The food is decent, the wine is of the cheap variety. Writing this to say: as an establishment if you are going to run a Groupon deal to ""enjoy"" your experience, it would be appropriate not to treat guests using it like less-than-customers. You're literally running this deal because you need the business...but the employees don't act like it. Very dismissive. Seems like they don't prioritize people who use the deal, which by the sounds of it from table to table, is the main reason people are there. Further, I don't like people touching my phone. I don't know who hurt the waiter but he is insistent on touching your phone and hitting the groupon voucher himself. Maybe don't treat people you've invited to your establishment via Groupon like they're trying to get one over on you? The whole experience was stiff.",Kerissa K.,3,4,2
" September 30, 2018",Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful experience ..the staff was very helpful kind and welcoming..i couldnt pull up my groupon voucher but the staff were kind enough to allow me to charge my phone and provided a charger ..great food and i was able to take a bottle of wine home ...other couples sitting next to us were very nice as well ...im def going to go back ....awesome deal,Lakeia T.,5,2,2
" October 8, 2018","2 drinks and bottle of wine pretty good , dinner was really really small , lucky I had a big lunch . Anything like potatoes, rice, etc was a lot extra. Without groupon would have been over a hundred without tip . Bottom line ok with Groupon , no way without lol",Michael E.,3,3,3
" December 9, 2018","The food was good. However beware, there is a sneaky tip the owner tries to include at the end. Be sure to pull out your calculator and do the math. The tip was 40% (yes 40%!!) of the $50 Groupon price. He charged a $20 tip on the $50 Groupon.",Krystal B.,4,1,1
" March 3, 2019","At first I was skeptical because  I saw a review on how they were charged $40 as a tip after they paid but I didn't have that happen to me. This was fun, the wine was good, the food was good, the waiter was nice. Overall I'd say it was great we even got two bottles instead of just one to take home which was nice. Def will be back with some friends.",Valarie A.,5,1,1
" February 11, 2019",Decent wine. Deceiving in that we had to pay the suggested gratuity which is ridiculous and should’ve been clearer on the groupon.,Hollie H.,3,1,1
" March 9, 2019","Great intimate experience! Went here on a date night with my husband and we love the service!!!  Wine tasting was very nice, food was good, the restaurant was very clean.

" January 21, 2019","I took a friend as a gift to 1742 Wine Bar. We had a good experience. The food was okay; I thought appetizer/s could have been better and larger portion. 

We would have preferred if we could have selected wines we wished to taste as opposed to wines preselected by wine bar.

Overall, we enjoyed our time at 1742 Wine Bar.",Ivette D.,3,4,4
" September 19, 2018","This was our first time there and the service was prompt and very pleasant. Great wines, the food was excellent in a casual NON rushed fashion.

" October 20, 2018","Did the wine tasting special. Loved the space, but it was rather noisey. Wines were very tasty and the pours were generous. Food choices were a bit limited, the portions were hearty, but nothing was anything special. Would I go back, though, which is the question? Yes, because the special was an excellent value. and at the end of the day, there was nothing to really complain about.",Jon S.,3,2,2

" February 23, 2019","The Wine Bar is a nice small quaint place enough room for great conversation to be heard by the company your keeping...the food was good when it arrived however,it took all of 50 minutes, drinks where nice but beware that this is a establishment that sets their own gratuity oppose to providing options and choices...",Rosalind P.,3,10,2

" July 19, 2018","Service was great.  Food was weak.  Had the steak and tilapia.  Steak was very thin but extremely chewy.  The massive amount of sauteed spinach overwhelmed the small cut of beef.  Tilapia looked like a flash frozen filet.  The wine choices were ok, again, not particularly exciting. Mediocre atmosphere with cramped tables. not worth the price.  Another $40 tacked on for gratuity and frzn pie.",Adam K.,2,1,1

" December 29, 2018","Great service, and the food and drinks were excellent!!",Erin M.,5,1,1
" December 7, 2016","BEWARE:This deal seemed like it was too good to be true, and I was right!!! The appetizer consisted of 1 piece of salami, pepperoni, ham and 2 pieces of cheese to split. The pasta meals were decent but small portions. The wine tastings were great and came with a very fair portion. 

HOWEVER, when the bill came after ordering a dessert, we were surprised to see a $30 tab. When we asked the waitress, she told us the 10% gratuity was calculated based on the ""estimated value"".. which she found to be $180!!! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 

Not only were we disappointed with that aspect of this groupon, the night we were at the wine bar they were offering the same deal to all customers except they got to take home TWO bottles of wine... 

Feeling very ripped off by this place, I do NOT recommend.",Jules B.,3,1,1

" September 25, 2017","Good food and wine. We had a nice time, waiter was knowledgeable, etc. The reason for my lower review is that this deal is immensely misleading. I live two blocks from this restaurant and they advertise this ""deal"" literally every day. It's the standard cost of this meal at their restaurant. But then they sell it as a $175 value on Groupon, and expect you to tip on that value rather than the actual cost. So this left us with a sour taste in our mouths. Nothing against the restaurant, just how they're using Groupon to make extra money in tips.",Sean D.,3,2,2

" July 30, 2017","The reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars instead of 5 has nothing to do with their service nor food, it has everything to do with their deception of the bill. 

This restaurant is very cute and comfortable with great vibes. Along with great vibes the food is very great. The service provided here was great, our waitress was great..great all around.

However I would beware of the decpetive bill that comes after this great service. At the end of your great evening you get charged taxes and gratuity.

Nowhere on the fine print of this groupon does it say anything about these fees. The gratuity is not 10% 15% or 20% of your groupon it is 10% of the original price!!!! $178.00. How crazy.

& on top of this unexpected bill this place is CASH ONLY with an atm machine of a $3 fee. 

You walked into dinner spending $50 and walked out spending $80....

Not great for a restaurant to deceive its paying customer..

Got check at the end of meal for taxes of $3dollars and tip 9 dollars. Why was the tip 9 dollars?  20% is 6 dollars, she seemed to have set her own tip amount.

The wine was very cheap but I had very good service the server knew all bout the wine or at least pretended he did the whole restaurant is very tight spaced",Brittany B.,3,1,1

" August 30, 2018",It was really good. Definitely your money worth. The appetizer was great to start and the entree was really delicious. I got the shrimp pasta and my husband got the chicken kebab and we were both very happy. Giving it 4 stars because while we did get served a lot of wine the wine was average and nothing out of the ordinary. Can't expect so much for the price though. Overall great experience!,Daniela E.,4,1,1
" February 11, 2019","This Groupon is very tempting due to the low price but that's because the food and wine is very lousy. 
The pizza was okay, but the cheese and charcuterie plate was the saddest thing I've ever seen. The whites in the tasting were lukewarm and watery. It sounds like a good value between the app and main and tastings and bottle, but spend $50 on something you'll actually enjoy.",Andrea E.,2,2,1

" August 6, 2018",Loved the food and appreciated that we were provided a spot at the bar even though we didn't book - decided to take a risk and turn up as we were in the area. The voucher came with 2 cocktails. We chose a margarita but were misheard and provided martini's - which is no big deal - it was strong - which is a positive but thought it strange that it didn't come with olives. The person next to us ordered a martini and received one twice the size with olives. We did enjoy ourselves and the food - I would just consider the sizes and quality served should be consistent if you have a voucher or not.,Patricia H.,4,6,4

 17 hours ago,"Groupon brought in a # of customers. Cocktails were Good, just long wait to get them to the table. Wine included in special, edible but not wine snob caliber. Cheese platter AWESOME.. steak/spinach good entree... pasta, while appealing on the menu was glad it was an additional option we paid for beyond Groupon. Dessert was just ok but MUST say was taken back by the charges of tax on what the restaurant viewed was the total value of the meal + adding a 20% gratuity",Alisa O.,3,13,8

The waiter/host/bartender was 1 person, but he was kind and made sure we were taken care of.. even though he was doing a million things at once.  The food was excellent! Everything well made.

Some people need a little extra room to be comfortable. I would recommend looking at some pictures before deciding to purchase the Groupon, if you’re one who wants that extra space. Beyond that the Groupon is definitely a good deal.",Jennifer H.,4,9,6
" October 20, 2018",I love this restaurant. I go often for dinner this was the first time i had brunch. French toast was tasty i also like the steak and pastas. Drinks get the job done. Will be back soon.,Diana A.,5,8,6
" September 17, 2016","Good value ! Rather nice place. The waitress was very nice, the food not bad for the price. There was a very loud group (+- 20 people) who were incredibly loud and ruined the atmosphere though. We could not even hear ourselves as the group was too loud.
Not sure the Groupon plan is a good deal though. I paid $49 for 2 people (1 main course for each, appetizers for 2, 6 samples of wine and a bottle). When you don't come with Groupon, for the same price, you get 2 bottles (I asked the owner). Conclusion : better to come without a Groupon deal.",Sophie S.,4,2,2

" March 24, 2019","On on top of the $39 price I paid for my deal  I was charged an extra $30.05 for an establishment-assessed 15% tip and some other charge I have not been able to decipher. 

My voucher was suppose to be $39 for a $108 value deal; for 2 people. We were given the option to take our $40 value bottle of wine home or to consume it there. We were given a wine list but when we had a question about 2 wines ($39 range) we were considering we brusquely were told the option would be red or white then narrowed down to “white wine” categories. In looking at the wine on the train ride home I demised the Chardonnay (allegedly from Spain) could have been bought at most liquor stores for under $10.00. Twist off cap. No cork.

What we got for the $69 incurred probably couldn’t be purchased in NYC for 2 people but it DID NOT rise to the level of being the $109 they noted on the check . . .",Arthur K.,3,4,2

 3 days ago,"Great deal but you can get the same deal cheaper by going to the restaurant. They have a big sign outside advertising $25 per person for a wine tasting dinner and each person gets their own bottle to take home. 

Worst part is that at the end they charge you $27 for tax and tip... I would go back again to the restaurant but definitely not the Groupon.",Christiaaan P.,1,1,1
" April 2, 2019","For $49 they choose your appetizer which is 2 pieces of slices bread, 3 olives 1 small piece of cheese and 2 deli sliced salami.

I order the steak over sautéed spinach, which was over cooked and dry and the spinach was salty.

The 6 type of wine (3) white and (3) red is all equivalent to one cup of wine.  

Then they charge you $25 gratuity fee.

So for $74 total it's not worth it.

Then wine they send you home with a bottle of wine which is nothing compared to what you drank in the restaurant.",Digna F.,1,1,1

The appetizer is pre-determined: two slices of cheese, two slices of bread, two slices of meat (this is not even on the menu of appetizers). 4 of the 6 wines were absolutely horrible. The one ok bottle (alboriño) he said they were out of, so we couldn't take it with us. They claim the total value is $137, so they ask for a $20 tip, which is a total lie; this is about $50 of service and food. Cash only, so this guy doesn't have to pay taxes. I expect this place will be out of business in two years. This is the last groupon for food that I'll ever buy. Big disappointment.",Donald D.,2,1,1

" October 8, 2018",The experience was great the place was great the food not so much I guess it’s mostly for the wine. My only thing is I didn’t like the gratuity charge which was on the whole value of the meal not the Groupon price. I think they should let you know from the start when you say you have a Groupon.,Amanda D.,3,2,1

" September 16, 2018","The price was good for the food and service. The cheese plate consisted of 2 pieces of mediocre cheese and couple pieces of cold meat (one of which looked like deli ham). The wine selection was average - a nice touch is that you pick one of the 6 tastings to take home. For entree, we both got the steak over a bed of sauteed spinach (unevenly seasoned) which was not impressive.",Jisun N.,4,2,2

" September 3, 2018",Decent but very tiny. What’s annoying is you didn’t need the Groupon. You could get the same deal as a walk in and get 2 bottles of wine. The 6 wine samples were okay. The red zinfendale was the best. The pasta sizes were ok. My bolognese was decent. Cannoli good! My wife’s chicken pasta was basic. Wouldn’t waste a cab from Times Square to here. Stop adding tip to the bill. Tip is up to the guest!,Tim D.,3,4,3

I was taken aback by the $24 extra I had to pay  in tax because It could only be paid with cash. I found it strange they had an  bodega style atm in the restaurant but then it all clicked.  So if you dont have cash you will pay the extra 24 in tax and gratuity, the atm fee, and any bank fees on your card.",Webster B.,4,3,2

" August 27, 2018","The deal was great! I enjoyed every bit of it, the food looked exactly as pictured on google reviews and the service was attentive and very kind. The wine was a little more than a taste, we were very satisfied with that ;). The only misleading thing was they charge 20.00 additional dollars for tax and gratuity and they don’t take card.

The deal claims two appetizers but they give you two plates of “anti pasta” which is actually just a couple pieces of very average cheese and meat. The wines were clearly watered down. The entrees we’re decent but not great. I was expecting to be able to drink the bottle of wine that’s included at dinner but they make you take it to go.,Briana F.,2,2,2

The staff explained the Groupon deal to us and made sure we undertood the terms. We got a bottle of white wine and it was pretty good however the food was only average. Ordered the risotto but it was not prepared correctly. It came out pretty fast so we know it wasn't cooked right. Still tasted ok. The other entrée was the shrimp pasta and it was a little bland. We also got the chocolate cake for dessert and it was decent. Also to note, you will have to pay the taxes for the Groupon voucher and they only accept cash for that. They accept credit/debit for everything else. All in all, great value for the Groupon deal but not likely to return to pay full value for the food.",Simon M.,3,1,1

" March 9, 2019",Most wines you could buy for under $5.00 per bottle. All the meats in the food seemed frozen. The appetizer could be made from $2.00 at the Walmart Deli Counter. The staff tried to charge us $40 gratuity when we payed a total of $72 for the groupons. When I asked the staff they said it was “suggested” to cover their own a$$ because they knew it was sleazy.

" March 9, 2019","There are so many resturants in NYC, I wouldnt waste my time with this one.  I feel the buisness model at this resturant is surviving off groupon.

" February 26, 2019",The waiter sat us at a table so small that our knees were pushing together and our feet were in between one another. We waited until another table came available.

The appetizer looks like something a 5 year old put together. The main pasta entrees weren't bad but not great. Definitely would not come back.",Nimita P.,2,4,1
" February 18, 2019","Extremely low quality meal. Overpriced even with the “discount”. 

There is not any discount with Groupon since you would pay exactly the same price without Groupon.

The appetizer is a piece of bread with ham and cheese, you cannot choose.

The main course is not good.

You cannot drink the bottle of wine there but you can only bring it at home.

They ask you additional tip and tax",Andrea D.,1,1,1
" February 17, 2019","Wines were ok, not my favorite. Meat and cheese was a slice of deli salami, small piece of cheese and cold bread. Main was ok but pasta sauce was watery. Broccoli seemed frozen. Would not purchase deal again but the ambiance is nice.",Dana D.,2,1,1

" February 15, 2019",the place was real pack and the services wasn’t good at all .,Milton G.,2,2,1
" September 26, 2017","Definitely worst Groupon experience I ever had.
We arrived at the restaurant with an online reservation(by email) and our table wasn't ready. We waited for almost 20minutes standing outside before we got our set.
It is actually a fake value on Groupon($170).
You can buy the experience directly at the restaurant for the same price($49 plus taxes).
If you buy it at the restaurant is also includes one more bottle of wine to take home. While with Groupon you get one bottle.
Food was actually horrible, appetizers very small (2 slices of salami and 2 of cheese) and entrees very bad cooked (over cooked shrimp and broccoli pasta).
The funniest part was when bill came. 
It supposed to be $53 (taxes included) but then we showed our Groupon and he made us to pay $23 more for tips and taxes. So we actually paid taxes on the fake Groupon of $170. When we tried to ask about it but the owner immediately became rude and he told us to leave. He also took back a bottle of wine we were suppose to get.He told us he didn't care about what we thought because he got many good reviews anyway.
I definitely wouldn't recommend this Groupon and this restaurant.",Flavio R.,1,2,2
" May 19, 2018",Tip and tax not included. Was an additional $19.75 (cash only) but still very nice food and very nice evening. Waiters are super nice. Not worth the price it’s valued at but definitely with it with the groupon.,Madeline B.,4,1,1

So the wine hits you hard! We had to order an extra pizza just to counteract some of the wine! We ordered the steak as our entree...so tiny! Also the meat and cheese plate they give you to start is actually comical...2 little wedges of cheese, a slice of salami, a slice of pepperoni, and a little piece of ham...all seems like it was from the grocery store deli department.",Kari C.,1,3,1

" December 29, 2018","Food isn’t great and the wines are cheap (like $12 bottles at the liquor store). It’s a good value for the sheer fact that you get two entrees and a bottle of wine, but you’re not getting anything special. And they tack on a tip based off of the menu prices of each item. Fine if you’re trying to have a cheap date night.",Stephanie T.,2,1,1
" December 25, 2018",Not worth it. The same deal is there as a promotion everyday and they don't try to put the extra gratuity when you don't go in with the voucher. Just saves you the hassle trying to get the additional $18 they try to add.,Mathew C.,1,1,1

" October 10, 2018","The place is very small and the paintings are broken mirrors are dirty. They demand reservation and nobody is in the place. The food was ok but the portion couldn't fill a toddler. You do not get to choose you appetizer they just give it to you me and my husband got 1 small piece of bread half a slice of salami and half a slice if ham cheese the size of a quarter and 3 olives. We had to keep requesting our drink to get filled while the manager is sitting just texting. There was only one other couple there and it took a long time before we got served. i ordered Gnocchi and they give you a half serving i was nowhere near full after. My husband got the steak it comes with no side and comes chopped up to look bigger but its only about 6oz over spinach, the plates are huge and the food fills 1/4 of the plate. What ruined the night for me is that nobody stated over the phone or online that it was cash only. I brought my credit card. Tax came out to 5$ and Gratuity was 25$ They have the credit cad machine and refuse to take payment less then 20$ The manager was disgusting yelling about his tip i offered a 10$ tip and 5$ for tax and told him to please swipe the credit card. He told me to leave and come back with cash and that we can not take our bottle with us. I then took a picture and stated i would leave a bad review because i live in another borough to do all that traveling is pointless.

" May 16, 2018","We were 10 minutes late for a 6pm reservation on a Sunday and were told it was an hour wait for a table so we could eat at the bar.  We were disappointed, but sat at the bar. The shrimp linguine had 4 shrimp and spaghetti noodles.  My dining partner complained and ended up getting in an argument with the bartender.  However, a couple who came in after us were told it would be a 1/2 hour wait for a table.  On the bright side, the wine was good and my tilapia was fine, but the argument spoiled the mood.  My friend told me not to book anything under groupon unless I knew the place was good already.",Karen R.,1,2,1

Disregard the photo of the cheese and meat platter shown in the add certainly not the real portion. The entrees were mediocre at best . I didn't know that Vodka sauce was supposed to taste sour.
  Was handed a bill at the end of the dinner for $23 cash only ( they direct you to an ATM in front)  for tax and gratuities.

" October 7, 2016","Good value. Steak was tasty and well prepared. 3 whites were good: Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanca and rioja Blanca. 3 reds were table wines - light and fruity. The temperanillo and montepucciano were a tad too light for us. We would have preferred a drier, more robust wine with a bit more structure to go with the steak. The last red was an interesting sweeter blend. Downside is cash only, no cc.",Phoenix D.,3,1,1
" July 9, 2016",It's a cute little Italian spot with very little options for main dishes. The meat and cheese platter was small. It was like 2 types of meat and 2 types of cheese with 2 little pieces of bread. I was with a group of 4 and all of our dishes were great. Our server was really nice and he gave us extra wine. We had 6 glasses in total which kind of had us a little tipsy at the end of the night. Overall it's a good little spot and we got two bottles of wine to take home from the one's we sampled. Using this Groupon they taxed us like $4 and they added a ridiculous amount for gratuity so we ended up paying another $30 extra after buying this Groupon.,Icilyn M.,5,2,2

The pizza my best friend ordered was good. And my best friend's sister ordered a steak dish and it turned out okay. 
THE BILL- when the bill came, they were nice enough to tip themselves 15% and then some. the tip was $22 alone and they charged me 80 cents for a single candle. PERKS-The deal came with 2 wines and we only had one and we were allowed to take the other one home.",Jennifer L.,3,5,2

What a hoax; I hardly call two small pieces of cheese, a couple slices of meat and some poorly toasted crostini's as a charcuterie plate.  Because of this we ordered appetizers (congratulations on getting me to spend more money) then the entree portions were not that great.  Thank goodness we did order appetizers otherwise we would have left hungry.  The wine tasting was very good, and we enjoyed it very much.  However I would love to know the person who quoted the ""retail"" price of this groupon at $170.  That is a joke.

There are 6 wine tastings.  3 white and 3 red.  You then get to choose which of the 6 tastings you liked best for your bottle to take home.  The food is good!  We have had the chicken, wheat pasta, spj, and Tilapia. We loved them all.  The place is small but the service is good.  Tony runs the whole show and makes you feel special.

" July 11, 2016","Food and service were great! My only complaint was that they charged gratuity that came out to $25. I think this was a percentage of what the groupon value was not what i paid for the groupon. I of course was going to tip but it is disappointing when you go some place with a groupon already paid for and then are required to pay an additional amount. Tip is supposed to be based on service, food, and experience. It is not something that is required or guaranteed and if they were going to require it they should have mentioned this in the fine print of my groupon. Something i thought was $50 turned out to be $75. Which is still a good value but again I did not appreciate that I wasn't made aware of the additional charge upon purchasing at which point I would have been able to make the concious decision to pay $75 for the groupon.",Cailin S.,5,3,2

They usually have two package deals here on Groupon....one with dinner and a bottle of wine, and one with dinner a wine tasting and a bottle of wine.  I prefer the one with the wine tasting and dinner because they give you a bottle of wine to bring home after your done and the other package they don't do that.  The wine tasting dinner is also nice because they explain all of the wines to you as your tasting them and then leave you to you intimate dinner.  It's a little tight in there not much room...but always crowded.....because this place is that good!

Some of the dishes is like that so read carefully and ask questions. Also dinner for 2 you only get 1 bottle to take home. If you want a 2nd bottle they'll aak you to rate them on Yelp to do so.

" March 6, 2017","This groupon isn't actually a deal, they advertise the same option on a sign outside the restaurant.

" June 23, 2017","Appitizer was equivalent to a lunchable. Half a slice of ham, salami, pepperoni and cheese. The actual wine experience was great, good selection. The dinners were great also. This brings me to the worst part of the deal. They claim this is a $130 value, which its not and they charge you gratuity on $130 which came out to $20. However they only charged us tax on what we spent on the groupon/deal ($39), tax was 4.95. It's weird to me that they over value the serviece to ensure a tip, but they don't charge tax on that value. There is a sign up front advertising our deal for $49, I wonder if they were charged gratuity on ""value"" or just the price they paid. Just shady, and it's a shame because with some honesty and good appetizers this would be a great place.
 So even though it was just two of us, we were charged 18% gratuity on the value not the price of the meal, theft! They didn't even disclose on the menu of an 18% gratuity on every bill, typically dining is over 6 people then an 18% charge is applied.",Daniel D.,1,1,1

We will definitely go back. Just want COLD white wine please.",Barbara C.,5,5,4

On the plus side, the wait staff was pleasant and attentive and the food was delicious.",Kimberly P.,5,9,8

" July 22, 2016","I am actually mixed about this ""deal"". You certainly get a lot for your money. The wine flights had generous pours. However, the wines were not that good. The app was not good at all, basically just deli meat. The mains however were good so long as you stay simple.",Fred I.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,Overall we had a good experience. But it's a long haul from Jersey to go all the way up to the UES for wines that are typical at best. We were expecting better wines to be honest. Instead the usual suspects were present.,Rich S.,1,3,1
" May 13, 2017","Well the wines were good. The steak had no flavor, burnt on top and rare in the middle. I told the waiter the steak did not taste good and was burned. He argued and insisted that's the way it's suppose to be. It took him several minutes to finally take it back and bring out another tasteless steak. It was horrible. I will never go back again.",Solmari R.,1,8,4

" August 13, 2017","Know that they only accept cash. The food was ok. Wait staff was ok. I arrived before my friends and the waiter didnt allow me to sit at a table even though the place was almost empty. I had to wait at a bar until my friend arrived and then we were seated. The place is very dark inside, its not a nice place to sit. The only outside seating are 2 tiny tables too close to each other so zero privacy.",Marie.drapal,3,4,2

So ""deal"", nope, but I'd go back for the food and order off regular menu without Groupon.",Jessicca G.,4,1,1

" February 8, 2016","Good time, large wine tastings, so you end up drinking a lot of wine.  However...Bring cash - the tax and tip and whatever else you may want to order is cash only.

 Invalid date,"The appetizer is a joke: Cured meats and cheeses. My husband and I each got a plate: 2 pcs of cheese, 1 piece of sliced pepperoni, salami and one rolled piece of ham. A green pepper. Plus two small pcs of crunchy Italian bread. My husband has a decent appetite so even though the Chicken Milanese was a decent piece of chicken it only had arugula on top - that's it. Salads or even more bread not included. He got two appetizers at a pub down the block after cause he was hungry still.  So that was disappointing. Really need to know the place before you go. Unfortunately, we don't live in area & it was our 1 year wed anniversary night out. Wine tasting was good. Our waitress gave my husband a little more red x 3 glasses b/c he forgo the white wines",Terri T.,5,1,1

We loved this place - busy, fun, a little noisy, delicious food.  Small portions yes, but fine by us.  The wine tastings were substantial and went all thru dinner so we carried the included bottle of wine home unopened.  My hangar steak was cooked perfect and Leslie's rigatoni with broccoli and chicken was delicious.  Get Eddie as your waiter if possible - he explained each wine tasting well and was a pleasure.

" June 5, 2016","I've purchased many restaurant groupons and have great experiences thus far. Yesterday, my fiancé and I had a horrible experience at 1742. Bread tastes as if they toasted it hours ago and left it out, cold and strangely chewy. I ordered the shrimp linguine. The food came out surprisingly quick, which I figured out why Within moments of having received my entree. The shrimp was cold to not defrosted entirely - very cold in the middle. After having the second one, I realized that the shrimp hadn't been cleaned. They 3 left had not been deveined - aka they digestional track with their poop was still there. Disgusting! The free bottle of wine: ordered a bottle of white - it came out below room temperature and every few sips she came and filled my cup. I've never felt so rushed at an establishment in my life. She had poured an entire bottle of white within 10-15 mins. It was unbelievable.. Wine can't be chugged! The entire time she seemed more concerned with 'Turning her table' (restaurant lingo for get us out to get new clients seated) then about our experience. To top it off, after one of the worst dinner experiences ever, she bought us a check including her very undeserved $16 tip included. I've been in the hospitality business 14 years, this was a disgrace",Karla G.,1,14,5
" August 2, 2016","The restaurant itself seemed cute and somewhere that I would typically check out.  However, I think by having the groupon we were only given a limited menu and there wasn't much to select from.  Nothing like what their menu shows online.  I ordered the steak, which was the thinnest piece of beef I have ever gotten.  It didn't even specify what the cut of beef was, but it was chewy and didn't have much flavor.  I even got it cooked medium rare, which was what my waiter recommended because of the thickness of it.   We were also tucked back into this little room, where they put everyone who had the groupon.  It was small, and extremely hot in the room.",Amanda G.,1,25,15

Were seated in an out of the way area with other groupon users, given a select menu that they were not able to deviate from (even when they offered to pay more) and the same was true for the wine selection. Their waiter was rude and rushed them out of the restaurant.

Not only was that odd but it was warmed however I have a feeling that is because the bread was stale.  The main course was alright.  Nothing impressive.  However the main reason for purchasing the groupon was for the wine tasting experience which was horrible.  The wines selected were not only cheap but poor tasting.  I work for a wine company and know of many inexpensive wines that taste terrific.",Paula V.,1,1,1

Did I find my high end appetizer containing lunch meats, specifically bologne?  Yes. Was my valued up to $37 take home bottle of wine, actually a $6.99 bottle?   Yes.

" September 13, 2016","I tried the $50 for the wine tasting with the entree. The food tasted awful & the wine was pretty cheap. To say this is valued at $178 is ridiculous. I got a much better deal for less than half the cost dining at Per Se, which is a way more luxurious restaurant. 

They added a mandatory $24 fee for gratuity and some service charge, coming out to $74 for a meal that shouldn't have been more than $40 (and still tasted awful).

I don’t know where those funds are going but, I’m sure it’s not going to the state. $15.00 gratuity on a $39.00 Groupon.

 Invalid date,"The restaurant itself is very quaint and charming. Small but that is NYC. The man tending bar (mgr I think) was not personable - no smile - no hi how are you... The appetizer offered with the groupon was a bit cheesey. Deli meats folded in half with two bite size chunks of cheese and bread. A salad option I think would have been more enjoyable and could have been more creative. The menu is limiting. Most main dishes were some type of pasta. Skirt steak over spinach was decent. Meat was cooked perfectly but some pieces were veiny and chewy. The wine tasting portion was fun. Decent pours, not the best quality wine but wasn't expecting much. All and all - my experience was ok and worth the groupon but I will not return.",Jennifer K.,1,6,3
" April 12, 2016","Wines for tasting were awful.  Using the Vivino app, cost of 1 bottle was $3.98and another was $1.97.  Food was absolutely terrible.   Worst groupon I ever bought.

Not worth your time and I am saving you from a horrible experience.",Andre P.,1,3,1

The food was sub par and very small potions. The biggest problem was at the end the waitress gave us a check for 23 dollars... That was for tax and gratuity. When we asked why 23 extra dollars she said ""that was a suggested 10% gratuity"" it was alittle overwhelming and seemed pushed.

" May 2, 2016","Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant or Groupon.  The food was VERY disappointing. From the limited selection to what you actually receive was not worth the investment. The service was good but the entire experience seemed rushed and like you were being pushed out the door. The staff was very knowledgeable about the wines, but the policy of you must take the bottle with you is very odd. It forces you to purchase additional glasses, while having to carry around your bottle all night.",Dan B.,1,5,4

" November 13, 2016",Went here for date night. Wine offered for wine tasting was cheap. Food was subpar. We ordered the skirt steak and spinach.

The Chicken milanese was pretty good but it included a tiny piece of chicken hidden under a plate full of arugala. The deal included a bottle of wine to take home at the end. You would think you would get a choice of a bottle after sampling 6 different wines. We got handed a bottle of a wine that we didn't even try, no questions asked. Then when we got the check, they said the total would have been $178 which seems outrageous. It seems like it was done so the waiter would get a much higher tip than they should have received.",Katelyn M.,1,18,3

The idea of the wine tasting was interesting, but almost none of the wines were that great, only one and that's the one we chose as the bottle we received... we had very good service from Michelle.  My husband had the skirt steak which, though a bit chewy, was tasty.   We came from Roosevelt Island to the restaurant, because we were going to the see a show at the Museo del Barrio and there is no place to eat around that area.

My guest also did not like how the toast for the appetizer apeared to be sitting out on the counter behind us and then most likely it seemed obvious that it was reheated and not freshly toasted.

" April 9, 2018","We nearly walked straight past as it is literally a door way. Although there were a few tables for food, I would definitely say it is more for locals to grab a drink. The drinks (wine especially) were great. the food on the other hand was just edible! It seriously lacked any seasoning/ stock or herbs. We did not like to complain as we were sat in a spot right next to the bar and being such a tiny establishment, we felt awkward. The decor contained naked women, along with some other randomly selected pieces. We could not detect a theme. The lighting was so low, we could just see each other. It did raise my concerns about the cleanliness of the place and me husband passed comment about dreading to think what the kitchen is like.
Conclusion; if you are after a drink, this is probably a great choice. If you are after a good meal, this is not the place. We both ordered pasta and they tasted like they had just been shoved in the microwave from frozen.
We chose this place after seeing good reviews on Groupon, but we wouldn't go back again!",Nici D.,3,2,2

" March 23, 2018","The appetizers are really a joke! Super small and very cheap quality. They would have done themselves a favor by just skipping the appetizers! The main (stake on sautéed spinach) was pretty okay. A little burned and chewy, but we also didn’t expect the highest quality stake there. They have us a lot of wine to taste (6 samples, 4 were good). The tip was $40.",Jens H.,3,4,2

" March 6, 2018","Felt like in the end; my partner n I was being rushed. They seem to get ALOT of ppl for the Groupon offer. So I suppose they’re trying to accommodate each guest but still atleast let your guest ENJOY the food and wine. They offer you a “free” bottle to take home out of the wine that has been presented. But u still have to pay “taxes” and “gratuity” in the end, which I felt was a bit pricey(the taxes) but heyyy.....

FYI the $49 Groupon isn’t just $49 just saying but the BBQ pizza was good...",Mica A.,3,8,2

If you are drinking wine you want enough cheese with it. I just got 2 little pieces plus some olives and 2 pastrami. I also didn't like the little table we got. It was tiny tiny. It was my 10th years anniversary and it wasn't that special.I still recommend it",Jenny A.,4,3,3

The servers were pleasant enough, but they forgot just about every request we made, so we got nothing we asked for for about 1/2 hour each time, and it took forever to get our food.  It finally came well after the people who came in after us, and when we asked about it, the waiter didn't apologize, he just said he ordered it all at the same time and didn't care (? might have been a language thing).

Champagne was flat, didn't even get the second round. Rigatoni was more like chicken noodle soup. Value & suggested tip were wrong, but gave it to them (value was $60, listed $61; at 15%, tip $9, listed $10). If they hadn't listed it, I was planning on 20%.",Sharon L.,3,5,4

We took home a bottle of the Chianti, as it was our favorite. We left full, happy, and warmed by the whole experience.

 Invalid date,"Really great small restaurant with friendly staff and fast service. I was pleased with the service and had planned to tip the waitress well, BUT when she gave us the bill she had added in the tip herself ($15), personally I would have tipped her $20 but the fact that she just went ahead and wrote it in herself, I personally found to be extremely rude and greedy. That left a sour taste in my mouth at the end of the dinner that was absolutely perfect. I WILL NOT GO AGAIN BECAUSE OF THAT.",Atin G.,5,4,1
