" March 2, 2019","Fantastic!  A hidden gem and comfortable!
Very professional Staff and quiet but not silent atmosphere.  Perfect for pre theatre relaxation.
The Bar is exquisite; the waitress, truly lovely and friendly, told me interesting facts and history of The Flûte.  It was originally a Speakeasy during Prohibition.
Comfortable for Solo visitors!",Janis L.,5,13,14

" October 6, 2018","Super cute place! We walked down a flight of stairs under this blue banner that says Flute Champagne Bar and we’re immediately greeted and sat in this cute little booth. I showed him my Groupon which he marked as redeemed and brought us this yummy bottle of champs. Then, this gorgeous tray of cheese and fruit arrived! We were so excited about the champagne, we ordered two flights of champs after!!",Mandi L.,5,1,1

" April 7, 2018","Cute venue but horrible service from a lady who really should be in an occupation other than hospitality.  She had zero interest in customer satisfaction and ruined the experience for both of us.  We ordered, quickly finished, tipped a kind gentleman and left. Dissatisfaction plus!

On a positive the champagne was very good. Groupon drives customers to your flaunting business, make it count.",Shane Z.,2,3,2

One appetizer would have been more than adequate for two of us, but we each ordered an appetizer to go with our champagne and couldn't eat everything.  Tasty and delicious!
