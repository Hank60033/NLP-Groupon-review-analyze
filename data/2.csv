" July 17, 2018",This place was amazing. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We never been to a vineyard before but love wine so we figured we‚Äôd do something new. The price was affordable for all they offered & the wine was amazing and of course after the tour & tasting we bought a bottle and sat out on the deck. My only complaint was they were very pushy about buying a case of wine.,Jennifer S.,5,3,3,1
" September 19, 2018",Beautiful vineyard and 2 of the most friendliest rottweilers greet you. Don't worry they look like  mean but they are so lovable and love people. I enjoyed many wines and cheese.,Heather M.,5,21,21,1
" November 5, 2018","Very intimate and lovely experience! We initially went to Reading Terminal Market because the location was listed as such but it is actually at a different location about a 15 minute walk away.

For most of the time my party and I were the only ones there so it was basically a private tasting. We went on a Thursday afternoon.

The staff was absolutely wonderful. My questions were answered in a personable and non condescending manner. We spent almost 2 hours here and didn't feel rushed at all.

This was truly an aamzing expwrience espically for the price.

" December 6, 2018","The first time we went for a tour and tasting and had a fabulous time! This time (just the wine and cheese pairing, no tour) felt rushed.

" November 12, 2018","Knats everywhere, two large dog were allowed to roam around the store even though a member of our group told them she was frightened by them, cheese was old (dried out edges) & as far as tasting the wine we were given a very small amount to sip.‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è",Kimberly A.,2,12,12,0
" November 8, 2018","This was one of the worst experiences of my life. The only good thing about it was the pre-packaged chocolates over which the employee had no control. We were greeted at the door by two huge Rottweilers, not a problem for me personally, but not a great idea for customers who dislike or fear dogs. We stood at a bar for the entire experience. We were given so little wine to taste, there was barely enough to have a pre and post chocolate sip (and I do mean sip)of each wine. And all but one of the wines we tasted had the stale taste of a wine that had sat for too long in an opened bottle. The woman who facilitated the tasting admitted that she did not regularly taste the wines and simply regurgitated the description sheets we receive during the tasting via rote memorization as an introduction of each. Glasses were not rinsed between wines. ""Palate cleansing "" achieved by an offer of miniature oyster crackers. The entire experience lasted less than 5 minutes. I gave a one star rating only because there was no option for zero stars. Definitely would not recommend to others.",Pat K.,1,1,1,0

" May 8, 2018","Given wrong address and location...drove for 4 hours to get to the right location they own.  Lady working the tastings was not very engaging.  Wines were ""so-so"" in quality.

We paid for 4.  Came without the 4th person.  We asked for 1 extra taste (1 sip) and they charged us additional $, when they were paid for someone who was not even there.  They made extra $ off us, but no means to compensate us for that missing person.",Robyne M.,3,12,12,0

" March 21, 2018","The wine wasn't the best I've had but it was still good. The people were lovely. The cheese was really good. I took my favorite wine at that time home with me. I wouldn't go back to that location because it wasn't as classy as I wanted it to be. I know the New Tripoli location would be a better fit because they have a big vineyard and all of that good stuff. The location I went to in philly is nice for tourists, or for people who are just getting a drink and walking around the rest of the building, because there is so much other stuff going on in the building other than the wine tasting place. But overall I love to experience new things and that was a nice experience for what it was worth. I will go back to buy wine of course, I just don't think sitting there for a wine tasting is good for me, too much going on around you.",Chekera C.,5,1,1,1

If you do your groupon on Sunday, there is a Sangria Sunday with music on the deck, but you need to use Groupon before 1 or after 2 (2:30); there is a vineyard tour at 12 noon.  Helpful suggestion to go for the noon tour and then do your Groupon.  Afterword, stay for the music on the deck with your bottle or Sangria.",Crisann N.,5,5,5,1

We totally enjoyed Virgil's presentation; the cheese and, definitely, the wine.
We were amazed to discover that Blue Mountain grows their own red grapes for the Merlot, etc.
Not normal in PA.
We went early (12:00PM) on Saturday and our first greeter was Vidal............a 100+ pound Rottie who is such a gentle soul. The next ""gentle soul"" was Virgil who made our stay a delightful treat.
Unlike others......no complaints.
We will definitely come back for another tasting.

" May 31, 2016",I have been to many Wineries and the Blue Mountain Wine-Tasting experience might be the only one in history where you leave more thirsty than when you came. $40+ for 3 people to get 5 little splashes of wine and some crummy WalMart quality chocolate. Want a little cheese&crackers or to hear the live music? - that's ALL extra cash. What a RIP-OFF.,Paul M.,1,16,16,0
" July 8, 2014",I thought I was going to the winery not a store in the middle of the local grocery store. The person who did the tasting was knowledgable and great but the atmosphere is not conducive to a wine and cheese pairing class.,Melissa B.,1,17,17,0
" May 4, 2014","Not sure what the Groupon was about, but paying much more than just walking in for sampling, was a rip-off. First, we supposedly paid for $30 worth of wine and cheese pairing for 2, when anyone can just come in and pay $5 per glass, without the $.50 worth of cheese given. There was no tour included in the Groupon. The winery's location and building is beautiful, but the state of dissaray around us was unappealing. There were very few tables and chairs on this beautiful and spacious deck, and you had to make sure you didn't trip on the many patio umbrellas laying everywhere around you, trying to get to a table when it opens up. It is ashame that the owners don't take better care of business.",George O.,1,8,8,0
" February 23, 2014","The wine and cheese pairing ""class"" offered was a plate of cheese bits and a woman who had no idea about how to pair them. She didn't offer a new glass for each wine tasting, or even rinse out the glass in between. Not at all worth the money.",Kathleen O.,1,2,2,0
" October 8, 2013",The standard wine tasting is 5 per person and includes 5 samples. The group on was 17 for two samplings as well two glasses and a cheese pairing. Personally the cheese wasn't my thing and I have plenty of my own wine glasses. I probably would been just as satisfied with the $5 sampling per person that is offered by the vineyard.,Eric G.,1,1,1,0
" February 5, 2018","participated in a wine and cheese pairing class. any semblance of education was not forthcoming. here's your cheese. here's your wine. enjoy. have been to numerous professional pairings. this is not one of them. p.s. compared to other wine prices on the ""Lehigh valley or Berks wine trails"", Blue Mountain is pricey. very commercial atmosphere.",Tom P.,2,10,10,0

 Invalid date,"First off the Wiow Grove location is inside a Giant supermarket. It has a small counter to stand at. Although tasting pours were generous, the guy behind counter knew little about the wine and was unable to answer even basic questions.",Joshua J.,1,16,16,0

 Invalid date,We thought this was a vineyard tour.  We planned on an outdoor experience.  Maybe we misunderstood.  Lecture was informative but could have been 15 minutes instead of over an hour. Did not feel it was worth the value. Overbooked.,Lois B.,1,1,1,0

 Invalid date,"I was disappointed that the Wine and Cheese tasting was not what I expected.  In the future you should not have a bridal party / wine and cheese groupon customers / walk in customers just for tasting and only (2) people, the owners working.  It was Memorial Day and we specifically called ahead of time to make sure that we would be accommodated.  Also if you are going to reuse cheese that was previously out at the Sunday's tasting you probably want to keep that to yourself because as a customer that was not what I was expecting.  I was very disappointed especially because we were there for my mom's birthday.   I know there were others there that felt the same way and purchased the same groupn",Laura R.,1,6,6,0

 Invalid date,"Joe's talk was fun and educational. It was disappointing, though, that standing in a basement constituted the ""tour."" His wife, who was running the wine tasting, was frazzled -- and she let us know it. It made for an uncomfortable ordeal. She exclaimed that we ""must have multiplied downstairs."" WHAT? Your poor planning should not be reflected onto the customer WHO IS PAYING YOU to be there. I also didn't like the way the wine tasting was run. I did wine tasting at Mount Hope where much bigger groups are handled effortlessly. MH uses teeny plastic cups and serves one wine at a time to all tasters. The wines are described. We left MH with a case of wine; I bought 3 bottles at BMVC.",Kathryn P.,1,5,5,0
 Invalid date,"No place to sit and fully enjoy the wine. They should get bar stools. Also they didn't have the wines we liked open, so we couldn't taste them.",Lena S.,1,2,2,0

 Invalid date,The customer service was very inefficient. The glasses te crackers and chocolate were served in were dirty and the timeliness of our wine server was so slow.,Pattie B.,1,1,1,0
 Invalid date,you can walk in and get 5 wine samples without buying a groupon!!!!! one tiny cm of cheese is not worth the groupon,Emilee S.,1,3,3,0
 Invalid date,"I think we could have rec'd 7 samples instead of just 5. Not even a half glass of wine total, and our whole party of 8 purchased over 200.00 worth of wine,..",Patricia M.,1,2,2,0
 Invalid date,"Off the street, anyone could walk in and pay 5.00 for a wine tasting with a small plate of cheese cut in sizes for mousetrap that you had to share. With Groupon we had to pay 17.00 for that same thing. We also had to make reservations and it was so crowded at the bar we couldn't even stand there but off to the side.  Not accurate description of what we bought to what we got.",Sharon S.,1,44,44,0
 Invalid date,"Even for the $17---it was definitely NOT worth it!!! ---a few pieces of cheese---5 swallows of different wines & a glass--------and a LONG trip out in the middle of no-where!!  and I would have had to pay $8 extra each for a tour!!!!  NEVER GOING BACK------NEVER RECOMMENDING!!  
I'll be much more careful with my Groupon purchases!!!!",Linda D.,1,9,9,0

 Invalid date,"This was a ""wine and cheese"" tasting.  Nothing special from just a stop by and sample wine.  Chese was presented but nothing was said about the cheese, where it was from, what it was, nothing.  We did purchase some wine but don't think it was worth the Groupon price.  If interested in good locally produced wine go one of their locations and sample.  Leave the cheese for the dairy.",Keith H.,1,3,3,0

" October 7, 2013","felt like we were ripped off. could have gotten a wine tasting for $5 each than they give it back to you if you buy a bottle of wine. so i paid $17 for a litle bit of cheese and two wine glasses.

" June 4, 2012","The place its self was nice. Owner very friendly---rest of staff....not so much! Cashier had a major attitude. Also, if you did not spend a full $10 on merchandiseyou would only get 50% off an item. Most items were not included in the groupon. Also, on web it says they have a place for food....this means you can bring your own stuff. We had to leave and drive 20 minutes to find lunch.",Denise D.,1,1,1,0
