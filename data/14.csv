You can grab some munchies / wine at the Winery either before or after & if the weather is nice, the grounds are beautiful.

The wine tasting was superior with excellent information about each wine and a plate of cheeses and fruit and crackers to go with them. 16 wines later you are able to purchase additional food and drink and sit and enjoy the rest of your afternoon.

" February 23, 2016","When it came time for the wine tasting we entered a big room.  Most of the group was able to sit around the bar - however we were at the back of the group and ended up sitting at a table - by ourselves.  We felt a little disconnected during the wine tasting as a result.  The tour guide stayed behind the bar during the tasting and interacted very little with us.  They should either limit the number to how many fit at the bar, or have everyone sit at the tables.  Other than that it was a nice tour, the wines were delicious and it was a good experience.",Pamela E.,5,6,5
" February 23, 2016","Awesome tour/tasting. Great experience with passionate people. You do have 16 small tastings, so a light breakfast is advised. But they do have pairings with the wine, and food you can order afterwards. All very tasty!",Susannah G.,5,2,1

While the tour and wine stands were good, the tuperware with 5 crackers a few blocks of cheddar cheese was not a wine & cheese tasting. I thought we were going to see how their wines would go with different cheeses. And the free 1/2 bottle of white wine was not what the groupon stated. (It stated bottle of Merlot).

 Invalid date,"this was not a wine and cheese tasting. This was a wine tasting with 6 cheap squares of cheese, 4 crackers, 4 grapes and 3 hershey kisses. The 1 oz pour is so small that you don't get a true taste and guests are constantly standing in line for more. The use of tip cups placed at each tasting table was offensive since most of the wine was being poured by the owners and staff. No one seemed interested in offering information on the wines, they almost seemed annoyed when asked. With the large number of people and the small pours it doesn't leave time to ask questions when the staff is so busy just continuously pouring.",Caryn K.,5,10,5
 Invalid date,"I felt a little tricked by the ""two bottles of wine"" that were included with the visit.

 Invalid date,"the groupon stated ""two bottles of merlot"" we received two 1/2 sized bottles of white wine, already wrapped in brown bags placed in a plastic bag. The old switcheroo.  We'll probably still come back, tho.",Scott B.,5,1,1
 Invalid date,I would suggest with this deal a standard size bottle of wine be included not the half size. I would also suggest a little more wine in each taste test. The amount given for each taste was too little in my opinion.,David P.,5,5,4

 Invalid date,"Very impressed.  I have purchased your wine previously, but never visited your property.

 Invalid date,The offer was with Groupon included a bottle of Merlot.  We did get a bottle of wine but it was not Merlot and it was not a regular size bottle of wine.  It was a smaller bottle.  A little disappointing.  Other than that it was a great time.,Melissa M.,5,4,2

 Invalid date,Keep making those wines! Love the fruit wines.,Jeremy R.,5,1,1

 Invalid date,Liked the entertainment with wine tasting.,Donna B.,5,7,5
 Invalid date,"I very much enjoyed the wine tasting an tour and almost everyone was very friendly. The one down side was the woman in the store at the end. We went in to purchase wine and she was a bit nasty, somewhat short, and very impatient with us while we were trying to make our selections. My husband and I ended up purchasing four bottles and would have purchased more if we weren't being rushed to finish making our selections. I also had my in-laws with us and when my Mother -in -law was looking in her pocket for her ticket for her free bottle the woman said ""never mind, just tell me what you want"" in a very nasty manner and then said there was a line forming behind us. I turned around to see one couple that appeared to still be discussing what they were going to purchase. My In-laws ended up not buying anything and we just hurried out of there. All in all it was a fun time and I would go back but if I saw the same woman in the store again I would probably just skip buying anything.",Christine M.,5,3,3

 Invalid date,Thanks for a terrific date night!  Try to do the tour before the band starts playing cause it made it a little hard to hear in the beginning.  Shamong red is a must!  Champagne wines are amazing as well! Cheers!!,Brittany B.,5,5,3

 Invalid date,"Thank you for the hospitality!  It was very informative, and the set up was well organized. Kudos to the band, and your friend Randy for his input!  Though I was the designated driver, I was not able to fully indulge - until I got home : )",Donna S.,5,1,1
 Invalid date,"There was CLEARLY not enough appetizers/snacks. Each patron received one small ""airplane sized"" snack box. There were 2 soft pretzel stations that were wiped clear within  minutes of being replenished. When asked for more pretzels, we were told they were not bringing anymore out, because people were eating them too fast. (?)  Also, the offer stated a bottle of wine per person. This should state a mini bottle.  The cost of the tasting was $10 including ""snacks"", however, the winery website offers free wine tasting with purchase- which most people including myself did spend a good deal of money. So, basically it would have been better to do the free wine tasting with $10 wine purchase and buy an Antipasto platter  so you can actually eat.",Kerry G.,5,8,5
 Invalid date,"Very friendly, wine tasting room is spacious.  You are very generous with your samples.  This encourages purchase of your fine wines.",Arthur J.,5,1,1

 Invalid date,"We loved the whole evening.  the wines, the music, and the very interesting tour.  But would love to know when their Honey Wine will be ready.",Donna K.,5,13,9
 Invalid date,My only disappointment was that the Groupon stated I would receive a bottle of Merlot and it was a Cabernet/merlot blend. I even asked the lady if it was the Merlot and she said yes (it was already in a bag)but when we left and in the car I looked and realized it was the blend. I really liked the Merlot better then the blend so it was disappointing.,Sandra E.,5,3,2
 Invalid date,continued success and growth...hoping you become #1 in the state in volume(already have great quality),George P.,5,6,1

 Invalid date,I loved the atmosphere! The ambience of every room was warm and inviting. Simply beautiful! The staff was very friendly and polite. Glad I found my groupon! Will be back!,Lynda T.,5,2,2
 Invalid date,"I was there to buy wine but some of the tastings I got were so little i really could not get a good feel for the wine so did not buy it.  What I did buy i found I liked better when i got home than at the tasting.  Had I been given a better taste I may have bought more.  Also, the treatment I received may have something to do with my age.  younger servers seemed more open to younger tasters.  Just saying.....",Doreen C.,5,13,6
 Invalid date,"Thank you for a lovely evening, we enjoyed ourselves very much",Linda M.,5,13,9
 Invalid date,"Keep up the good work. You have a great facility, clean and inviting. The wine tour was interesting. Your wine tasting room is beautiful. Your Merlot is delish. I'ts worth the 1hr 20min drive.",Janine B.,5,1,1

 Invalid date,We had a great night at the winery. I brought my wife and 4 friends. You had a great band on that Friday night. The tour was interesting. The wine was very good. And most of all everyone that works there [and the owners] were extremely friendly and knowledgable. I recommended Valenzano to several people.,Frank G.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,The band was really good but it was hard to have any conversations while the band played. It would be better if the music was quieter.,Marla G.,5,2,1
 Invalid date,"My husband & I had a great time! Everyone was really nice and very friendly. We LOVED tasting the wine. Bought some oldfavorites and found a few new ones! We will be attending the The ""Wine & Comedy Night"" on April 6! CAN'T WAIT!!!!",Linda S.,5,8,5

 Invalid date,"Wonderful event, will be back with friends!",Myla R.,5,2,2
" March 12, 2018","This is more likely a Groupon issue than a Valenzano issue, but my Groupon expired for this tour for two. Tried to use the $ amount I purchased it for when visiting. The gentleman helping me did not know how to do that but said he would honor the tour. A month later my Groupon got marked as ""used"" when I never redeemed it for anything. Can someone help me with this? No way to ask Groupon on site",Lynnea T.,1,2,1
" November 22, 2017","When I went  on the Valenzano website to set up a reservation, it said that my Groupon code was already redeemed. However, I never used the redemption code prior to that day. I contacted Valenzano about it and the gentlemen told me that he would try and see if he could manually squeeze me in.. after a short email exchange with the gentleman, I never heard back about making a reservation.",Alexis L.,1,3,2
" October 25, 2017","I didn't use my Groupon because I reached out to Valenzano to reschedule my date and they never got back to me, I emailed them and call and they did not accommodate me.",Abby R.,1,1,1
" June 20, 2016",It was very expensive for what we actually got!,Rita D.,1,26,7
" December 20, 2015",I purchased my $69.00 Groupon in July every time I tried to make a reservation they didn't have any availability here it is December I had to take a lost and just do a cheese plate and tasting so disappointing i became very frustrated so I just want the gift bags that came with the Groupon and then I find out they give you a sample bottle of wine in the gift bag I was so unhappy for 69.oo It would have been nice to have a standard size bottle of wine,Nikki S.,1,3,1
 Invalid date,"bait and switch  the""free"" wine was one of the worst they had",Janet L.,1,22,5
 Invalid date,Wine was not as stated on groupon. We were suppose to get two bottles os merlot. First we got small bottles of wine and they were not merlot. The wine they gave us was vidal blanc. The woman told us it tasted like pinot grigio but it did not. The wine was awful.,Christina L.,1,3,3
 Invalid date,Cheese tray was cheaply presented,Tasia F.,1,4,3
 Invalid date,Very nice people.  However the wine was average at best.,Robert M.,1,3,2
 Invalid date,"The free bottle of wine was not what I expected (much smaller than what's mentioned on Group On. Cheese tray for 2 was a joke! 5 small pices of sharp cheese; not even enough for 1 person, let alone 2!",Vilma A.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"They we nice enough initially - but then cheated on the groupon deal by offering a cheaper wine at a smaller size then originally specified.  The Valenzano sweet wines have received good reviews in other places, but fruity wines are not to my taste -  I found the dryer wines (merlot and cab) terrible, they were very chemical in taste.",Catherine S.,1,2,1
 Invalid date,I did't really think the Friday night 'wine & cheese' tasting and tour event was worth the money.  But it was something to do.,Regina M.,1,8,5
 Invalid date,I felt as though the Groupon explanation was false advertisement. The wine and cheese event was not at all what I had expected. My husband and I had to share FOUR pieces of cheese some crackers a few grapes and two Hershey kisses. The wine tasting stations were ok. The explanation of the evening also said we would be leaving with two bottles of Merlot. We got home and opened our bags and they were two VERY small bottles of Vidal Blanc. I felt as though that should have been better communicated. I probably would not have purchased this Groupon had a known what the night would entail. We had been to the Valentine's dinner which was awesome so we had high hopes for the tasting and were let down.,Carrie C.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,Really felt all wine varietals were very weak.,Alexandra A.,1,6,4
 Invalid date,"The Groupon specificly stated we would be going home woth two bottles of merlot, that was the reason why I didn't grab the refund when it was offered after they changed the specific dates and times it was allowed to be used.  I was given a very small bottle of vidal blanc and told, ""that's what you get with the Groupon offer""  The lines were crazy long, WAY too many people there to have a relaxing tasting as were planning on.  I don't know over all, it was a vert disappointing trip.  By far the most disappointing Groupon I have purchased to date.  I won't be going back-",Missi A.,1,30,23
 Invalid date,Was supposed to receive bottle of merlot when there as was told they didn't have any recieved a little bottle (misleading) of white which I do not like.,Carole A.,1,26,1
 Invalid date,there was no tour. we never saw the winery. we were in a banquet hall.,Christine H.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"they didnt give us the advertized wine,-dissapointing",Donald B.,1,16,3
 Invalid date,It was ok,Mike B.,1,5,3
 Invalid date,wasn't that great. didn't care for plastic containers. not enough room to sit. 2 free wine bottles were 1/2 the size and white only.,Jennifer M.,1,7,6
 Invalid date,"The wine tasting aspect was excellent. The people pouring wine were knowledgeable and friendly.However, we were told that we would get a bottle of merlot upon leaving. We waited in line to get our bottle and were handed a bottle in a brown paper bag. When we got home and took the bottle out of the bag, it was not merlot. What a disappointment!",Lisa H.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"This was a poorly run event in my opinion and was definitely falsely advertised. This was not a small educational wine tasting. It was more like 200 people in a ball room with three different wine stations set up that you could wait in line to get a tiny bit without really getting any information on the wine. Additionally the two free ""bottles"" were not normal size bottles of wine. There was a ""tour"" of the facility, but it was 20 minutes long and really didn't provide much information on the actual wine. Perhaps I had higher than normal expectations but this was a disappointment.",Nicholas R.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,The above comment.,Ellen M.,1,23,15
 Invalid date,Very dissapointed with the cheese plate and the amount of wine for tasting.  I was expecting a full bottle of Merlot as pictured in the description.  This was not a $48 value,David C.,1,14,3
 Invalid date,"Smaller events, more intimate.",Allison M.,1,3,1
 Invalid date,At the tasting it was difficulty because u got less than a mouthful of wine.  Difficult with that amount of wine. It may be different if u visited and it was 't a Groupon,Vivian L.,1,6,4
 Invalid date,way overcrowded. groupon misleading. We were supposed to get two bottles of merlot. WE received 2 half bottles of vidal blanc. The cheese and crackers were amazingly cheap. Not a very enjoyable evening.,Susan L.,1,15,6
 Invalid date,"This tour was disorganized and too informal to be called a ""tasting"".  Also, the cheese left a lot to be desired. I thought this would be more informational and instead it was a chaotic atmosphere.",Erica F.,1,2,1
 Invalid date,"The deal on this Groupon was a bit misleading, as the bottles of wine we got with the offer were not full sized. Though I enjoyed the experience, it was not really a good Groupon value.",Kim M.,1,2,2
 Invalid date,"The tasting was not well run.  We had to ask that they rinse the glass in between the wines.  They told us they had cheese and crackers for us because there was ""plenty [of prepackaged food] left over from the night before.""",Vicki Z.,1,3,1
 Invalid date,"Disappointed that you did not live up to the deal and only gave us half bottles rather than whole, and not of the promised wine, and the cheese plate left a lot to be desired!",Rob G.,1,11,7
 Invalid date,I just didn't care for the wine...sorry.,Sandra M.,1,13,7
 Invalid date,"I thought the facilities were beautiful, but I didn't care for their wines.",Patti G.,1,2,2
 Invalid date,"Please make Groupon users feel welcome when we call on the phone for information.  I was ""pushed"" onto the website...very impersonal...and never got the same answer twice about groupon use...no matter whom I spoke to or e-mailed.  It seems you were overwhelmed by the Groupon response.  Plan ahead.  Know what you want to offer your customers.  Put it out there correctly the first time!  Don't change it as you go along!  Being kind to customers goes a long way.  Being unkind is always remembered.",Denise G.,1,3,2
 Invalid date,felt more like banquet hall than a winery.  would like more intimate cozy quiet wine cellar for tasting,Andrew B.,1,5,4
 Invalid date,Please make some way that you can explain the different wines to customers at tastings. I have been to wine tastings at other wineries and they explained all of them to us as we tried them. It made for a better experience and makes me want to come back again and again.,Iris L.,1,1,1
 Invalid date,"I was disappointed with the music.  It was loud and not good for conversation.  Many of my friends enjoy touring Winerys and find that nice soft jazz music enhances the Winery experience.  That is my only real negative comment. I think if I knew the music was different, I would return with my friends.",Christine S.,1,2,2
