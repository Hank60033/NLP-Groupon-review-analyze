" February 4, 2018","Nice atmosphere and cool place, but when we walked in we didn't know what to do or where we could sit. There were several tables and pool tables reserved for parties but they didn't all have reserved notes on them so we kept having to get up and move. The food was great though and the wait staff was friendly, when I was finally able to get someone to talk to me. No one told me there was a virtual waitlist for a pool table though, even though I asked about playing twice. My bf and I did go on a busy night but by the time they told me there was a list we was 13th in line for a pool table. We waited an hour and decided it was wasn't worth it. After having been there for 2.5 hrs. So, we didn't even get to do 50% of the groupon. 

I think your experience with this place really varies on the night you go and who's working. I can give it to them that the evening was busy, but my experience wasn't great so I would recommend going when there are fewer people. Maybe Monday night? (We went on a Thursday.)",Monique,3,5,1,0

The girl didn't bring our appetizer until we had 10 mins left and then tried to kick us out before we were done. A shame too because we work in the industry and tip regardless but they just assumed we were cheap.,Alyssa Marie D.,3,2,2,0

" January 6, 2014",The threesome appetizer was cooked more as frozen food and tasted funny and the beer that was available with the Groupon voucher wasn't good either.,Marta,1,26,1,0

" January 31, 2017","i took my fiancee out . i saw the pool hall on groupon service was horrible. I told the manager I had a Groupon.  I waited 10 min no waitress. a saw a couple to my left just come in waitress went straight to them. waited another 15 min. still no waitress so I told the manager where was my waitress, decided to not even bother and we left. I wouldn't recommend this place although the ambiance was nice I will never go back.",Eric B.,1,6,1,0
" December 20, 2016",customer service could be much better. Decor is great. Games are great. employees spend too much time talking amongst each other. Not a good look,Bekky,2,111,48,0
" May 26, 2015","The only problem that we had that our server told us that with the groupon we can have only domestic beer, which is  according to her are yengling and Coors light ... I never thought that Blue moon, Sam Adams and Anbrgy orchard come from oversees",Mariya S.,1,1,1,0
" June 5, 2014",Groupon did not specify that it only had one beer option and only one option for appetizer entree.,Edward C.,1,9,6,0
" January 29, 2014","The groupon description was incorrect, according to the manager.  He said he had spoken with groupon many times regarding this issue but that it wasn't being resolved on groupon's end.  The description said we could choose one appetizer, and one domestic draft beer(this was the reason I purchased the groupon) along with one hour of pool.  When we arrived, we were told we had no choice and that the groupon was for a bucket of four bud bottles.  While discussing the matter with the manager, who tried to press ""redeemed"" on my voucher WITHOUT my permission by the way, he agreed to a pitcher of Yuengling (the cheapest of the domestic drafts). Groupon should not = 2nd class customer.",Valerie G.,1,8,7,0
" January 21, 2014",The groupon was a lie. The bartender gave us the hour of pool for two but when it came to selecting the appetizer and beer she said we could only get Coors light for the beer and we couldn't pick our own appetizer. Do not buy this groupon!,Erik O.,1,11,4,0
