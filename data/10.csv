" November 11, 2018",The location was great. It was crowded but still easy to get around. It was rather warm inside but bearable. There was a good variety of vendors/samplers. Worth the price of the Groupon for sure.,Irene V.,5,15,15

" October 23, 2018",It was okay. I think I expected more in terms of brands and food. But it was worth it to get Barrie’s intense ginger liqueur!!! Holy moly that stuff is insanely good. That I would give 5 stars for. If you love ginger you can get it here http://barrowsintense.com,Harry P.,3,1,1

" December 2, 2018","I had a good time. There could have been more whiskey vendors. What threw me off was when I saw Vodka, wine, Gin, probiotic vendors. They could have named the event Wine & Spirits tasting. The availability of food vendors were poor. They had a DJ playing good music, entertainment games such as Jenga, connect four and cornhole in addition to a free photo booth.",Angie D.,3,6,4

" February 10, 2019",Experience was ok. They need to form lines in front of each booth. It would eliminate the wait on lines. Very disorganized. Food was great. Parking was terrible but I knew this going into my old stomping grounds.,Salvador B.,3,4,2

 5 days ago,I had a really nice time. There were many delicious wines to sample. My only complaint was there should have been free food included in the ticket price. I’ve been to other wine festivals where the venue had food.,Derina S.,4,2,1

 3 days ago,Great service and a great experience so many new whiskey companies I never heard of!!!!!!!A++++,Jamel C.,5,1,1
" April 25, 2018","Session one has more vendors and some vendors from that session. Session two has more music and can be a bit more crowded. Also, some of the vendors run out of certain wines earlier. all depends on timing and when you get there. I enjoyed both however. The music from session two really was enjoyable and it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded when  went.",Teandra J.,5,6,1

" February 2, 2019","Very fun show, but a lot of people, several long lines at big name vendors. A lot of food options, but with even longer lines, so do eat before the event. For $49pp, it was a fun way to spend a Friday night.",Ilya T.,4,1,1
" February 2, 2019","Merchants and selections were really good and they were very friendly. The only reason I gave a 4/5 was because we took pics in the photo booth which only gave the option for them to be emailed and we have yet to receive them. I contacted the vendor, they said there was WiFi issues and they’d send them again, still never got them. Overall, everything else was great",Pierina L.,4,3,3

" January 27, 2019","Wine and food are awesome, but a small selection. Some of the vendors ran out of supplies by 715 which was disappointing. Overall a very nice experience",Alexander R.,4,1,1
" January 27, 2019","The ordering process was kind of clumsy.  I was apparently supposed to have received an Eventbrite email after following the multiple step process of accessing a number and going to another website to enter it. The activated Groupon on my phone was ultimately accepted, but the entry person acted like she was doing me a favor to do it. Wine selection was okay.",Karen B.,4,2,1

" November 11, 2018","It was a fun event, not too crowded, a good selection of vendors, we were definitely able to experience some new items. As a suggestion it would be good if they had a better selection of refreshing items. While they had water at all the tables, it was lukewarm. Having cold water would be more beneficial.",Sasha G.,5,1,1

" May 13, 2018",Definitely was an awesome time my friends and I loved all the beers they had will definitely be going again if they have it,Lindsey G.,5,14,7
" April 4, 2018",They sold way too many tickets for the size of the venue and for the amount of wine vendors. The place was really hot and there were lines for every single wine tasting. And when you finally got to the front of the line the vendors would give you a spit of a taste of wine so you could barely even taste the wine. It was fun and I got to try many different wines. There were also games which was nice,Alicia V.,3,4,2
 2 days ago,The event was adequate in terms of the whiskies and staff from the distilleries. Unfortunately I had to use the bathroom 10 minutes before the event closed and was sent on a wild goose chase from one w d of the event to the other being told one bathroom was closed and had to go to a different one. Ultimately I was unable to use the bathroom before leaving which I thought was ridiculous at an event where you’re drinking for three hours. It made me feel like I was back in high school. Just make sure to wear your Depends if you go.,C L.,2,1,1

" February 19, 2019","The event had way too many clothing, candle etc vendors.  There was barely any wine, we had to keep going back to the same tables because they were so crowded you couldn’t get a sample the first time around. Very disappointed with the quality this time.  Definitely didn’t feel like winefest, but rather vendorfest.",Shondell B.,2,19,12
" February 11, 2019","Abysmal selection of wine, all of which was bottom shelf quality to begin with. The entire expo center reeked of fried food which entirely detracted from the ability to properly taste.Vendors were unwilling to engage with people to explain their products at all. Also, this was billed as a wine drinking endeavor, when it was in actuality a combination wine/spirits/coffee tasting activity. 

Truly a lackluster experience, one that I'll not be repeating anytime soon. Only thing that saved it from being one star was the fact that they got me buzzed enough to have a good time despite all the nonsense encountered.",Brent S.,2,1,1
" February 10, 2019","Had an argument with a woman who began yelling g and cursing and she complained so I and a bunch of friends were thrown out by security. 
I refused to leave until we were refunded or money. 


If you're black just be careful. The owner of the event is racist. He would not even speak to me or my friends who are all black.",Shawna L.,1,2,1
" February 9, 2019","It was ok, very crowded and the wine was mediocre. Wouldn’t go back.",Nicole L.,2,2,1
" May 13, 2018","Inspite of the rain, the merchant did a great job shielding from the rain! Lots of breweries and good music!",Mary E.,4,4,1
" February 2, 2019","The event has changed from previous years. In the past there would be a nice range of new and established whiskey brands from around the world - American, Japanese, Irish, Scotch, Canada, etc.There was also a few “experimental” or “craft” brands. 

This year, it was nearly 100% new age American young whiskeys. I was told there that I t was intended to be a “craft whiskey” fest. But that’s not what the ticket said. One scotch, 2-3 Irish. The rest were “young” or no age statement American craft whiskeys. 
Vendors were proud that their whiskey was only aged 2 years “because that’s the best age for whiskey”. Or they would infuse flavors to “mask the harsh whiskey” bite. WTF. It tasted like I was drinking whisky syrup. There was also a lot of distilleries whose main liquor was not whiskey. They made gin and vodka, oh and also a whiskey. 

There’s a ton of good whiskey out there in the world. I have no issue with new companies trying to make a mark. But you cannot have a whiskey fest without a complete sampling. It was way too biased to new young flavored whiskeys. 

If it’s like this again next year, I probably won’t go.",Max,1,1,1
" February 2, 2019",Low budget “festival” that isn’t worth the price of admission. “Free” whiskey glass turned out to be leftover “Wine Fest” glasses. A lot of the tables ran out of samples by 9:00 PM. Very disappointed.,David M.,1,6,4

" October 26, 2018",Wasn’t great! Not enough vendors,Danielle T.,1,13,5
" October 22, 2018","This event definitely has potential. There should be a signature cocktail with each whiskey offering a taste either straight or mixed. At the very least some mixers such as cola or ginger ale should be offered. It was near impossible to purchase a bottle of water. At an event like this water should be easily available. After about an hour it became challenging to taste nothing but whiskey or a lemonade. With changes to any of the above, I would definitely give it another chance.",Jason T.,2,10,3
" October 20, 2018",We’ve been going to these types of events for 4 years ... a couple of times at this venue - less and less engaging ... seems to be thrown together - not even worth Groupon price,Kelly F.,1,26,20

" October 10, 2018","Terrible setup. There was no way it was close to being a legit beerfest. The food was horrible and the beer selection was terrible! A complete scam if you ask me. There was only about 25 breweries to choose from. The people behind the beer were very nice but for anyone who paid full price, I feel sorry fo them. The venue was way too small for anything more than a nightclub event. Next time either pick a bigger venue or don’t waste people’s time with this sad excuse for a beerfest. I wish I could get my money back for this.",JOhn,1,2,2

The music and Vibe made it easy to have a good time anyway.",Alyssa M.,3,4,3

 Invalid date,"There should have been a rain date set up for this event. This was an outdoor beer festival in the middle of May and it ended up pouring.

They got us in super fast and food was phenomenal— give me more empanadas",Mark C.,5,1,1
" March 12, 2018","The event was nice. Organized and very crowded. Some of the vendors ran out of wine before the last hour and the water to rinse your glass wasn't replenished at each table. I don't think they were prepared for the crowd. Also, there was good for sale, but nothing gratis Abe with that much wine, you would need at least some crackers.",Kalisha D.,4,15,5

" February 13, 2018","Great event,  but they need more food... perhaps even as simple as pretzles and peanuts.   People are consuming quite a bit of spirits and something to fill the stomach would go a long way.",Gregory B.,4,2,2

" February 10, 2018",Great experience with very knowledgeable volunteers and brand ambassadors!,Alison H.,5,12,6
" February 5, 2018",It was fun overall but entirely too crowded. Next time consider offering tickets in sessions to allow more room for patrons to move around. We left early because there were too many people. Also couldn’t figure out why none of the food vendors in the food court were open - it would have been perfect for additional food options. The food offered was too limited.,Melanie A.,3,3,1
" February 5, 2018","This was a lot of fun- so happy to go for the discounted price. Only concern was parking. The event website said it would be $5 but no lot in the area had that price, the best was $11.",Brittnay C.,4,4,4

" February 3, 2018",Great experience !!,Angel L.,5,1,1
" February 3, 2018","The space was too tight for the amount of people that attended.  Waiting on lines that were at times 6 -7 people deep at tables was not fun and the wait to get food at times exceeded 30 minutes, which is unacceptable at an event that is only 3 hours.  If they do this again they either have to move it to a larger venue or cut down drastically on the # of tickets they sell.",Edward R.,3,1,1
" February 3, 2018",Too crowded. Concept is a great idea but flooding the floor with people completely nullifies the positives of the experience.,Ralph C.,3,1,1
" January 11, 2018","Event was highly unorganized and poorly staffed for the amount of people who attended. They closed coat check because they didn't have enough racks. Looks like they only had enough for 100 coats and there was over 300 people there.   I believe there was 4 bars but each had 1 or 2 bartenders. So enjoying the 5 hour ""premium"" open bar was pointless because the wait for a drink was 25-30 mins. Smdh",Dennys F.,3,5,1

" January 2, 2018","The only negative comment from me is the fact that there was no organization at bar, there should’ve Been one line formed as opposed to 50 people crowding the bar. We had to order six drinks at once or be subjected to the madness at the bars, i really felt bad for the bartenders. Otherwise the event was great, the Dj was awesome, great crowd, and premium liquor. I would definitely attended another",Jessica S.,4,11,6
" January 2, 2018","The event was very well organized and the location was terrific.Inside was very open and nicely put together. Parking was very convenient,and very reasonable.. My only complaint was the limited access to the 4 bars locations, It was almost impossible to get to any of the bars a short time into the celebration there wasn't enough bartenders 2-the locations of the bars were to close to the areas where there was the largest amount of people making getting around difficult.The DJ and the food was very good I would definitely recommend this venue for another New Years event. Had a good time and it was well worth the cost...",Bruce J T.,4,1,1

" January 1, 2018","We had a really nice time, the music was on point, the food although not the warmest, it was tasty.  We got there at 9, so was able to have plenty of drinks, the people that came later has to wait in long lines, perhaps something different for next year.",Harold W.,4,9,5

" May 14, 2017",I had such an amazing experience at my first brewfest! I'm definitely there next year! the rain didn't stop the fun! Great beers. Amazing sushi. The pretzel twist...omg. Live band... great! Matter of fact... Groupon put me on the list now!,Christine S.,5,15,10
" May 14, 2017",Great time. Great atmosphere. Great beer,Tyler B.,5,1,1
" May 14, 2017",Great time in spite of the rain,Janet W.,3,14,2
" May 13, 2017",It was freezing and raining. There were openings from tent to tent. Not enough heaters.,Lauren N.,4,2,2
" May 13, 2017",Considering the constant rain.. excellent turn out ... some woman caddy schmucks ... all vendors beer/ cider people very friendly informative... considering all the consumption of alcohol they should have water stations ... and many workers of tropix were more focused on drinking themselves... unfortunate and no reflection on event itself,Kelly F.,4,26,20
" February 23, 2018",level of noise of the music played was umbearable,Candida B.,2,1,1
" February 16, 2018","Don't go, waste of money, even with groupon.",Lena K.,2,2,1
" March 13, 2018","Was oversold and the lines were way too long-an hour for food at a 3.5 hour event. Vendors began to run out of wine by 8:15, there were maybe 10 left from 8:45 til close",Joscelyne K.,2,1,1
" March 12, 2018",The event was unorganized and crowded. It started at 6PM and there were tables that ran out of wine by 7PM. The wine itself was extremely subpar. I wouldn't go back to this event as it was a waste of time.,Samantha S.,2,1,1
" March 11, 2018",Groupon posted the wrong address on their groupon offer. It took us 45 minutes to find the location. We ended up getting to the even around 7:30pm. The address and the parking were not very clear on groupon or the event website. We we got there there was no clear idea of where the entrance was or where we need to go to get our voucher redeemed. We  had to walk to the other side of the building to get our vouchers redeemed and get our bracelets. There was a coat check. We get to the check in our jackets and the girl tells us that we had to buy our tickets from the person who redeemed our groupon voucher! We had asked the person who redeemed our voucher that same very question and he directed us to the coat check lady. At this point we were very aggrevated with the whole situation. This was supposed to be a sisters night out that turned into a mission to find this place. After all of this. We finally made it into the wine tasting at 8:15pm. We could not enjoy the whole event due to the wrong address being listed and the lack of clear directions posted as well as the lack of organization of the event. The lines for the wine tasting were extremely long. We ended up tasting wine from only 5 tables. The amount of people for the space provided for this event was crazy. I felt like a packed sardine.,Leash O.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018",The event was very crowded and many vendors ran out of wine during the event.,Susan T.,1,7,1

" March 11, 2018",The venue was overcrowded. The wines were cheap and average.,Stephanie M.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018",The first 30 mins were great.  But the event ended up being way way way too crowded.  We ended up leaving at 8 because it was too big of a hassle to even move around.  They either need a larger space or two sessions with half the people.  I would love to go again if changes were made.,Allison H.,2,1,1
" March 11, 2018",Long lines; too crowded,James M.,2,1,1
" March 11, 2018",OVERSOLD! Could barely walk around . 5-10 minutes wait to get a taste of $4.99 wine.,Robert G.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018","Way too many people, no organization, cheap wine, lines everywhere, insufficient restrooms, etc.  Paid a lot of money and only stayed a half hour because it was so poorly organized.",Colleen T.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018","The entire event was very unorganized, and wine selection extremely subpar.",Janet H.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018","Unfortunately this event was a total waste of money. They barely had any wine vendors and so as a result the lines were insane just to get one sip. They had a bunch of food and chachi vendors, but if you are going for the wine, you are better off buying a few bottles yourself. Save your money. This was terrible.",Christina R.,1,2,2
" March 11, 2018","Way too crowded!!  With thoughtless yuppies.  And jeez, turn off the heat!!!",Liz,2,6,3
" March 11, 2018","Not enough wine vendors as last year 
Way too many ppl and lines 
It was more like a yard sale with food trucks",Cynthia L.,1,4,2
" March 11, 2018","Would not recommend this at all.  The people who pour the wine don't even know anything about wine, grape, etc. This is nothing like an actual wine tasting and is for amateurs. Extremely disorganized..",Julia E.,1,1,1
" March 11, 2018",Very crowded and unorganized.,Rose C.,1,2,1
" February 3, 2018","A lot of the very nice bourbons and scotch ran out early, and they ran out of water to clean glasses. Also it would have been great if they would have had more food vendors the food lines were so long and took forever.",Luis P.,2,7,3
" February 3, 2018","Very crowded, unorganized. You can hardly get a sample. Also limited food options for purchase.",Rose C.,1,1,1
" February 3, 2018",Get there early and leave before it gets crowded. I wish they charged more and sold less tickets. The crowd was just too large.,Cynthia Z.,2,1,1

" February 3, 2018",It's unbelievably crowded.  You can hardly get to fill your glass. It's like trying to walk in Times Square on NYE.   I should've purchased the designated driver ticket ... can't drink anyway.  You have to really be super aggressive.,Jill M.,1,11,4
" January 27, 2018",People should be informed that you would have to stand outside on line to enter for thirty minutes.  It was a cold night as well.,Gina V.,1,3,3
" January 20, 2018",Cheap liquor and lines to drinks were 30+mins waiting,Rashri J.,2,4,1
" January 19, 2018","The venue was nice, and that's the only reason I gave this experience two stars.  The food served was cold, and the lines for drinks and the restroom were unbearably long.  We left immediately after the ball dropped.  The way in which the bar lines were managed was exceedingly frustrtating.  I would never give this experience a second try.",Christopher,2,1,1
" January 5, 2018","Not enough bartenders, had to wait an hour to get a drink. Coat check filled up and had to hide our coats around the venue. Not prepared for the amount of people. Would not go again.",Kevin T.,1,1,1
" January 3, 2018","Poor and cold food, 40 minutes in line to get one drink.

DJ was good.
I wouldn't buy again,",Taline F.,1,2,1
" January 3, 2018",The venue was great but there were way too many tickets sold. It made for overcrowded conditions. An open bar was part of the admission costs and waiting more than 30 minutes for a drink is not fun and we did not enjoy the event due to too many long lines. It was also a very chaotic check in/coat check process. Would not attend this event again.,Jimmy L.,2,35,21
" January 2, 2018",couldnt get drinks at the open bar,Christina Z.,1,2,1
" January 2, 2018","Took 40 minutes to get a drink. Was nearly impossible. Coat check area was a mess and food was just placed on random tables and by the time you cold find it, it was cold . Pics are of how long the lines were to get drinks, like 40+ people.  Didbt even get my discounts money's worth",Teresa E.,1,11,2
" January 1, 2018","There was no way to get to he “open bar” for drinks because there were so many people. 45 mins in line, got me one drink, the food was okay, but the DJ sucked and played nothing but ratchet rap songs all night. All in all— would not recommend to anyone.",Leilani S.,1,14,7
" January 1, 2018","Food was cold & limited. No champagne toast & the DJ messed up on the count down to the New Year.!!
Men were going to the ladies bathroom & horrible cable wires above the ceiling. Safety issue!!
Limited seating & the music was not good. Will not return next year.",Darlene R.,2,6,1
" January 1, 2018","The line for a drink took over an hour and you were lucky to get a glass of champagne before midnight.  The food was mediocre and coat check was filled and closed by 10:30pm.  It really was unfortunate, I chose this event over more popular events in NY just to avoid traffic but now I regret it.  Overall, this party had potential; however, it’s organization and management was not up to par.",Jason P.,1,3,1
" January 1, 2018",Waste of money and eve!! Open bar for300 plus people with only 2 bartenders,Brenda Armendariz A.,1,1,1
" January 1, 2018","This was awful. Ran out of coat check within an hour of entry and lines for drinks were over a half hour for an “open bar.” Big scam, would not recommend to anyone, ever.",Chris G.,1,1,1
" October 15, 2017","There were a lot less beer options than I expected.  In many cases, the limited options available ran out before the end of the evening.  I also expected a live band, but there was simply a generic DJ playing music. Overall, a big disappointment when compared to other festivals I have attended.",Michael C.,1,14,2
" May 19, 2017",Vendors and beer were amazing but this event should have been cancelled due to heavy rain. We stood in puddles all night with cold windy rain in our faces. We would have preferred to get a rain date.,Carolyn C.,2,8,2
" May 17, 2017",Should not make us celebrate in rain boo on you. Still a good time,Tatiana T.,2,3,1
" May 16, 2017","It was ok line was long but that's the usual. The weather was horrible raining and bad winds throughout the event. Very crowded because tropix just too small
To host an event like this.",Edwin J.,2,8,3
" May 16, 2017","It was pouring out and while they did put up tents, the tents were too small and had no sidewalks. Everyone was soaked and the floors flooded. Beer samples were decent.",Stephen G.,1,21,1
" May 16, 2017","It rained, which obviously couldn't be helped. What COULD'VE been helped, however was making sure the place wouldn't flood if it did rain. My socks were so soaked that I had to get new sneakers after attending this event.",Ryan M.,1,1,1
