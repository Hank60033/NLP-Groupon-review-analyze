# NLP-Groupon-review-analyze



## Motivation and Objectives
What are the major concerns of customers for a wine bar? Food? Service? Price? Can others’ review affect your bar choice? In this report, we are going to unveil those essential features behind all kinds of bars using EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling on Groupon data. Groupon is an American worldwide e-commerce marketplace connecting customers with the cost-saving local merchants. They offer the coupons for some foods, service, travel, activities at a substantial discount in many markets. Customers can write reviews, providing a star-rating along with open-ended comment after they use their Groupon. Base on that, the reviews can have effects on consumers’ choices and the merchant’s reputation. For instance, a one-star increase led to a 59% increase in revenue of independent restaurants. With the rapid growth of buyers and users, we see a great potential of Groupon restaurant reviews as a valuable insights repository. In this project, we are focus on the wine bar in New York City. We want to find out the strength and weakness for each wine bar in New York City. Also, we try to identify that what aspects they need to be improved and give their suggestions.
